abstract = {The Osteoarthritis (OA) Criteria Subcommittee of the American Rheumatism Association set out to develop (a) a classification of OA that includes recognised subsets; and (b) subsets of OA identified by a combination of clinical and laboratory features. For the purposes of classification, OA should be specified if of unknown origin (idiopathic, primary) or if related to a known medical condition or event (secondary). Clinical criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the knee were developed through a multicentre study group involving 130 patients with OA and 107 comparison patients. Comparison diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other painful conditions of the knee exclusive of referred or para-articular pain. Variables from the history, physical examination, laboratory test results and radiographs were used to develop sets of criteria that serve different investigative purposes: clinical examination (sensitivity 89{\%}; specificity 88{\%}); clinical examination and laboratory tests (sensitivity 88{\%}; specificity 93{\%}); clinical examination, laboratory tests and radiographs (sensitivity 94{\%}; specificity 88{\%}). In contrast to prior classification criteria, the proposed criteria utilise decision trees or algorithms. Clinical criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the hip are under development. Comparison groups are comprised of patients with other rheumatic diseases (e.g. RA), periarticular pain (e.g. trochanteric bursitis) and referred pain (e.g low back pain). From a method of opinion sampling, OA of the hip may be suggested by a combination of clinical criteria including the following: age greater than 40 years, weight-bearing pain, pain relieved by sitting, antalgic gait, decreased painful range of motion, a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and a negative rheumatoid factor test.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relevance of ongoing nociceptive joint inputs to the maintenance of widespread pain hypersensitivity in patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and to determine whether a reversal in the widespread pressure hypersensitivity together with an improvement in pain and function occurs after total hip replacement in these patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Forty patients with hip OA participated. Twenty patients underwent total hip replacement, and the other 20 patients were assigned to a waiting list. Pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs) over the second metacarpal bone and the gluteus medius, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and tibialis anterior muscles were assessed bilaterally with a pressure algometer before and 3 months after total hip replacement surgery. Assessments of pain intensity (by visual analog scale [VAS]), physical function (by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), and health status (by the Short Form 12 health survey and the EuroQol 5-domain index) were also performed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty exhibited a reduction in widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia (increases in PPTs) over local and distant pain-free areas, as compared with before surgery and as compared with the patients assigned to the waiting list. PPTs were related to hip pain intensity, and significant correlations were found between higher VAS scores and lower average PPTs over all points assessed (-0.409 {\textless} r {\textless} -0.306, P {\textless} 0.05). Patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty exhibited a greater decrease in pain intensity and greater increases in function and health status than did those who were on the waiting list. Changes in the intensity of hip pain were moderately associated with changes in pressure pain sensitivity in the hip arthroplasty group.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Normalization of widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia was found after successful hip joint replacement in patients with hip OA. Altered pain processing seems to be driven by ongoing peripheral joint pathology, which stresses the importance of reducing pain in OA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In a cohort of well-characterized patients with different degrees of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and pain, the aims were to utilize mechanism-based quantitative sensory testing (QST) to (1) characterize subgroups of patients; (2) analyse the associations between clinical characteristics and QST; and (3) develop and apply a QST-based knee OA composite pain sensitivity index for patient classification. METHODS Two hundred seventeen OA pain patients and 64 controls were included. Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grading scores were obtained, and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), temporal summation of pain to repeated painful pressure stimulation and conditioning pain modulation (CPM) were assessed. Associations between pain score/area/duration, radiological findings and QST-related parameters were analysed. A pain sensitivity index was developed and applied based on PPT, temporal summation and CPM. z-Score, as statistical tool, was calculated for statistically comparing the pain index of a single patient with a healthy control group. RESULTS High knee pain associated with low KL grade showed particular signs of pain sensitization. Patients showed significant associations between clinical knee pain intensity/duration and lowering of knee PPTs (p {\textless} 0.01), facilitation of temporal summation (p {\textless} 0.01), reduction of CPM function (p {\textless} 0.01) and high pain sensitivity index (p {\textless} 0.01). The index classified 27-38{\%} of the OA patients and 3{\%} of the controls as highly sensitive with no association to KL. The index increased for high knee pain intensities and long pain duration. CONCLUSIONS Radiological scores, contrary to clinical pain intensity/duration, were poorly associated with QST parameters. The pain sensitivity index could classify OA patients with different degrees of OA and pain.},

abstract = {Pain is the dominant symptom in osteoarthritis (OA) and sensitization may contribute to the pain severity. This study investigated the role of sensitization in patients with painful knee OA by measuring (1) pressure pain thresholds (PPTs); (2) spreading sensitization; (3) temporal summation to repeated pressure pain stimulation; (4) pain responses after intramuscular hypertonic saline; and (5) pressure pain modulation by heterotopic descending noxious inhibitory control (DNIC). Forty-eight patients with different degrees of knee OA and twenty-four age- and sex-matched control subjects participated. The patients were separated into strong/severe (VAS ??? 6) and mild/moderate pain (VAS {\textless} 6) groups. PPTs were measured from the peripatellar region, tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles before, during and after DNIC. Temporal summation to pressure was measured at the most painful site in the peripatellar region and over TA. Patients with severely painful OA pain have significantly lower PPT than controls. For all locations (knee, leg, and arm) significantly negative correlations between VAS and PPT were found (more pain, more sensitization). OA patients showed a significant facilitation of temporal summation from both the knee and TA and had significantly less DNIC as compared with controls. No correlations were found between standard radiological findings and clinical/experimental pain parameters. However, patients with lesions in the lateral tibiofemoral knee compartment had higher pain ratings compared with those with intercondylar and medial lesions. This study highlights the importance of central sensitization as an important manifestation in knee OA. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal pain disorders are the second largest contributor to global disability underlining the significance of effective treatments. However, treating chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic joint pain (osteoarthritis (OA)) in particular, is challenging as the underlying peripheral and central pain mechanisms are not fully understood, and safe and efficient analgesic drugs are not available. The pain associated with joint pain is highly individual, and features from radiological imaging have not demonstrated robust associations with the pain manifestations. In recent years, a variety of human quantitative pain assessment tools (quantitative sensory testing (QST)) have been developed providing new opportunities for profiling patients and reaching a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in chronic joint pain. As joint pain is a complex interaction between many different pain mechanisms, available tools are important for patent profiling and providing the basic knowledge for development of new drugs and for developing pain management regimes.},

abstract = {Quantification of the human painful sensory experience is an essential step in the translation of knowledge from animal nociception to human pain. Translational models for assessment of pain are very important, as such models can be used in: 1) basic mechanistic studies in healthy volunteers; 2) clinical studies for diagnostic and monitoring purposes; 3) pharmacological studies to evaluate analgesic efficacy of new and existing compounds. Quantitative pain assessment, or quantitative sensory testing (QST), provides psychophysical methods that systematically document alterations and reorganization in nervous system function and, in particular, the nociceptive system. QST is defined as the determination of thresholds or stimulus response curves for sensory processing under normal and pathophysiological conditions. The modern concept of advanced QST for experimental pain assessment is a multimodality, multitissue approach where different pain modalities (thermal, mechanical, electrical, and chemical) are applied to different tissues (skin, muscles, and viscera) and the responses are assessed by psychophysical methods (thresholds and stimulus-response functions). Many new and advanced technologies have been developed to help relieve evoked, standardized, and painful reactions. Assessing pain has become a question of solving a multi-input, multi-output problem, with the solution providing the possibility of teasing out which pain pathways and mechanisms are involved, impaired, or affected. Perspective: Many methodologies have been developed for quantitative assessment of pain perception and involved mechanisms. This paper describes the background for the different methods, the use in basic pain experiments on healthy volunteers, how they can be applied in drug profiling, and the applications in clinical practice. ?? 2009 American Pain Society.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to systematically review whether the presence of altered central pain modulation pre-surgical influences outcome after total knee replacement (TKR) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), and if so which indices of central pain modulation predict poor outcome after TKR.To identify relevant articles, PubMed and Web of Science were searched. The search strategy was a combination of key words related to "Knee Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement", "Central Pain Modulation" and "Post-Surgical Outcome Measures". Articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were screened for methodological quality and results were analyzed and summarized.Sixteen prospective cohort studies were included. Strong evidence is available that presence of catastrophic thinking and poor coping strategies predict more pain after TKR and that there is no association between fear of movement and post-surgical pain or function. Evidence on other psychosocial influences is limited or conflicting. Literature on the influence of other signs of altered central pain modulation on post-surgical outcome is scarce. It is plausible that pre-surgical signs of altered central pain modulation, such as joint pain at rest or widespread pain sensitization, predict more post-surgical pain.Surgeons should be attentive for patients with signs of altered central pain modulation before surgery as they might be at risk for unfavorable outcome. A broader therapeutic approach aiming to desensitize the central nervous system can be adapted in these patients. Further research is however needed to identify the influence of central pain modulation pre-surgical in predicting outcome after TKR.},

@article{Beard2013,
abstract = {Background: In the majority of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee the disease originates in the medial compartment. There are two fundamentally different approaches to knee replacement for patients with unicompartmental disease: some surgeons feel that it is always best to replace both the knee compartments with a total knee replacement (TKR); whereas others feel it is best to replace just the damaged component of the knee using a partial or unicompartment replacement (UKR). Both interventions are established and well-documented procedures. Little evidence exists to prove the clinical and cost-effectiveness of either management option. This provides an explanation for the high variation in treatment of choice by individual surgeons for the same knee pathology. The aim of the TOPKAT study will be to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of TKRs compared to UKRs in patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis. Methods/Design: The design of the study is a single layer multicentre superiority type randomised controlled trial of unilateral knee replacement patients. Blinding will not be possible as the surgical scars for each procedure differ. We aim to recruit 500 patients from approximately 28 secondary care orthopaedic units from across the UK including district general and teaching hospitals. Participants will be randomised to either UKR or TKR. Randomisation will occur using a web-based randomisation system. The study is pragmatic in terms of implant selection for the knee replacement operation. Participants will be followed up for 5 years. The primary outcome is the Oxford Knee Score, which will be collected via questionnaires at 2 months, 1 year and then annually to 5 years. Secondary outcomes will include cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction and complications data.},

abstract = {Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) has lately become a neglected phenomenon. However, in recent years, investigations of the possible risk factors (type of surgery, preoperative pain, acute postoperative pain, and psychological and genetic factors) have also gained as much importance as the clinical problem. CPSP is not only observed following major surgery, but also following minor surgical procedures, such as hernia and vasectomy. Definitive data regarding the incidence of CPSP have not been obtained yet, since it is difficult to develop standard methods to resolve this difficult and complicated clinical picture. Many different medications, such as gabapentin, ketamine, venlafaxine, lidocaine, tramadol, and steroids have been tested in addition to multimodal analgesic techniques for the management of CPSP. Hence, preventive analgesia is a broader application of preemptive analgesia that includes any preoperative analgesic regimen able to control the sensitivity induced by pain.},

abstract = {With the extreme dimensionality of functional neuroimaging data comes extreme risk for false positives. Across the 130,000 voxels in a typical fMRI volume the probability of at least one false positive is almost certain. Proper correction for multiple comparisons should be completed during the analysis of these datasets, but is often ignored by investigators. To highlight the danger of this practice we completed an fMRI scanning session with a post-mortem Atlantic Salmon as the subject. The salmon was shown the same social perspective-taking task that was later administered to a group of human subjects. Statistics that were uncorrected for multiple comparisons showed active voxel clusters in the salmon's brain cavity and spinal column. Statistics controlling for the family-wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) both indicated that no active voxels were present, even at relaxed statistical thresholds. We argue that relying on standard statistical thresholds (p {\textless} 0.001) and low minimum cluster sizes (k {\textgreater} 8) is an ineffective control for multiple comparisons. We further argue that the vast majority of fMRI studies should be utilizing proper multiple comparisons correction as standard practice when thresholding their data.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Residual pain is a major factor in patient dissatisfaction following total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). The proportion of patients with unfavourable long-term residual pain is high, ranging from 7{\{}{\%}{\}} to 34{\{}{\%}{\}}. There are studies indicating that a preoperative degree of central sensitisation (CS) is associated with poorer postoperative outcomes and residual pain. It is thus hypothesised that preoperative treatment of CS could enhance postoperative outcomes. Duloxetine has been shown to be effective for several chronic pain syndromes, including knee osteoarthritis (OA), in which CS is most likely one of the underlying pain mechanisms. This study aims to evaluate the postoperative effects of preoperative screening and targeted duloxetine treatment of CS on residual pain compared with care-as-usual. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre, pragmatic, prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial includes patients with idiopathic hip/knee OA who are on a waiting list for primary THA/TKA. Patients at risk for CS will be randomly allocated to the preoperative duloxetine treatment programme group or the care-as-usual control group. The primary end point is the degree of postoperative pain 6 months after THA/TKA. Secondary end points at multiple time points up to 12 months postoperatively are: pain, neuropathic pain-like symptoms, (pain) sensitisation, pain catastrophising, joint-associated problems, physical activity, health-related quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and perceived improvement. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee (METc 2014/087) and will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (64th, 2013) and the Good Clinical Practice standard (GCP), and in compliance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO).

When surveyed, physicians report that the patient's sex has no effect on their decision-making; however, what occurs in clinical practice may be different. The purpose of our study was to determine whether patients' sex affects physicians' decisions to refer a patient for, or to perform, total knee arthroplasty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seventy-one physicians (38 family physicians and 33 orthopedic surgeons) in Ontario performed blinded assessments of 2 standardized patients (1 man and 1 woman) with moderate knee osteoarthritis who differed only by sex. The standardized patients recorded the physicians' final recommendations about total knee arthroplasty. Four surgeons did not consent to the inclusion of their data. After detecting an overall main effect, we tested for an interaction with physician type (family physician v. orthopedic surgeon). We used a binary logistic regression analysis with a generalized estimating equation approach to assess the effect of patients' sex on physicians' recommendations for total knee arthroplasty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 42{\%} of physicians recommended total knee arthroplasty to the male but not the female standardized patient, and 8{\%} of physicians recommended total knee arthroplasty to the female but not the male standardized patient (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 2.4-7.3, p {\textless} 0.001; risk ratio [RR] 2.1, 95{\%} CI 1.5-2.8, p {\textless} 0.001). The odds of an orthopedic surgeon recommending total knee arthroplasty to a male patient was 22 times (95{\%} CI 6.4-76.0, p {\textless} 0.001) that for a female patient. The odds of a family physician recommending total knee arthroplasty to a male patient was 2 times (95{\%} CI 1.04-4.71, p = 0.04) that for a female patient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Physicians were more likely to recommend total knee arthroplasty to a male patient than to a female patient, suggesting that gender bias may contribute to the sex-based disparity in the rates of use of total knee arthroplasty.},

We reexamined this issue to determine if contemporary TKA implants might be associated with improved patient satisfaction. We performed a cross-sectional study of patient satisfaction after 1703 primary TKAs performed in the province of Ontario. Our data confirmed that approximately one in five (19{\%}) primary TKA patients were not satisfied with the outcome. Satisfaction with pain relief varied from 72-86{\%} and with function from 70-84{\%} for specific activities of daily living. The strongest predictors of patient dissatisfaction after primary TKA were expectations not met (10.7x greater risk), a low 1-year WOMAC (2.5x greater risk), preoperative pain at rest (2.4x greater risk) and a postoperative complication requiring hospital readmission (1.9x greater risk).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

The epidemiologic and economic analyses in the first part of the book suggest that policy-makers should make chronic disease a priority. This book highlights the issues and focuses on the strategies and interventions that policy-makers have at their disposal to tackle this increasing challenge. Strategies discussed in the second part of this volume include (1) prevention and early detection, (2) new provider qualifications (e.g. nurse practitioners) and settings, (3) disease management programmes and (4) integrated care models. But choosing the right strategies will be difficult, particularly given the limited evidence on effectiveness and cost−effectiveness. In the third part, the book therefore outlines and discusses institutional and organizational challenges for policy-makers and managers: (1) stimulating the development of new effective pharmaceuticals and medical devices, (2) designing appropriate financial incentives, (3) improving coordination, (4) using information and communication technology, and (5) ensuring evaluation. To tackle these challenges successfully, key policy recommendations are made.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the enormous success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), chronic neuropathic pain can develop postoperatively and is both distressing and difficult to treat once established. We hypothesized that perioperative treatment with pregabalin, a chronic pain medication, would reduce the incidence of postsurgical neuropathic pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of pregabalin (300 mg) administered before TKA and for 14 days after TKA (150-50 mg twice daily). Patients were screened for the presence of neuropathic pain at 3 and 6 mo postoperatively using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs scale. Secondary outcomes included postsurgical recovery and rehabilitation measures, including knee range of motion, opioid consumption, postoperative pain scores, sleep disturbance, and time to discharge as well as the occurrence of postoperative systemic complications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 240 patients randomly assigned to the 2 treatment groups (120 in each), data for the primary outcome were obtained from 113 pregabalin patients and 115 placebo patients. At both 3 and 6 mo postoperatively, the incidence of neuropathic pain was less frequent in the pregabalin group (0{\%}) compared with the placebo group (8.7{\%} and 5.2{\%} at 3 and 6 mo, respectively; P = 0.001 and P = 0.014). Patients receiving pregabalin also consumed less epidural opioids (P = 0.003), required less oral opioid pain medication while hospitalized (P = 0.005), and had greater active flexion over the first 30 postoperative days (P = 0.013). There were no differences in the actual recorded duration of hospitalization between the 2 groups, although time to achieve hospital discharge criteria was longer for placebo patients, 69.0 +/- 16.0 h (mean +/- SD), than that of pregabalin patients, 60.2 +/- 15.8 h (P = 0.001). Sedation (P = 0.005) and confusion (P = 0.013) were more frequent on the day of surgery and postoperative day 1 in patients receiving pregabalin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Perioperative pregabalin administration reduces the incidence of chronic neuropathic pain after TKA, with less opioid consumption and better range of motion during the first 30 days of rehabilitation. However, in the doses tested, it is associated with a higher risk of early postoperative sedation and confusion.},

abstract = {Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder associated with significant morbidity, which includes severe episodic pain, and, often, chronic pain. Compared to healthy individuals, patients with SCD report enhanced sensitivity to thermal detection and pain thresholds and have altered inflammatory profiles, yet no studies to date have examined biomarker reactivity after laboratory-induced pain. We sought to examine this relationship in patients with SCD compared to healthy control participants. We completed quantitative sensory testing in 83 patients with SCD and sequential blood sampling in 27 of them, whom we matched (sex, age, race, body mass index, and education) to 27 healthy controls. Surprisingly, few quantitative sensory testing differences emerged between groups. Heat pain tolerance, pressure pain threshold at the trapezius, thumb, and quadriceps, and thermal temporal summation at 45°C differed between groups in the expected direction, whereas conditioned pain modulation and pain ratings to hot water hand immersion were counterintuitive, possibly because of tailoring the water temperature to a perceptual level; patients with SCD received milder temperatures. In the matched subsample, group differences and group-by-time interactions were observed in biomarkers including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1$\beta$, interleukin-4, and neuropeptide Y. These findings highlight the utility of laboratory pain testing methods for understanding individual differences in inflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest amplified pain-evoked proinflammatory cytokine reactivity among patients with SCD relative to carefully matched controls. Future research is warranted to evaluate the impact of enhanced pain-related cytokine response and whether it is predictive of clinical characteristics and the frequency/severity of pain crises in patients with SCD. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {Overdiagnosis is the diagnosis of an abnormality that is not associated with a substantial health hazard and that patients have no benefit to be aware of. It is neither a misdiagnosis (diagnostic error), nor a false positive result (positive test in the absence of a real abnormality). It mainly results from screening, use of increasingly sensitive diagnostic tests, incidental findings on routine examinations, and widening diagnostic criteria to define a condition requiring an intervention. The blurring boundaries between risk and disease, physicians' fear of missing a diagnosis and patients' need for reassurance are further causes of overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis often implies procedures to confirm or exclude the presence of the condition and is by definition associated with useless treatments and interventions, generating harm and costs without any benefit. Overdiagnosis also diverts healthcare professionals from caring about other health issues. Preventing overdiagnosis requires increasing awareness of healthcare professionals and patients about its occurrence, the avoidance of unnecessary and untargeted diagnostic tests, and the avoidance of screening without demonstrated benefits. Furthermore, accounting systematically for the harms and benefits of screening and diagnostic tests and determining risk factor thresholds based on the expected absolute risk reduction would also help prevent overdiagnosis.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis is among the leading causes of persistent pain and disability across the world. A broad array of international studies have confirmed that while total joint replacement is a beneficial and cost-effective treatment for end-stage OA, patients experience tremendous variability in post-operative pain and functional outcomes. Identifying predictors of long-term outcomes following joint replacement would be a crucial step in identifying high-risk patients who could potentially benefit from additional, potentially preventive treatments. To date, a few prior studies have suggested that individual variability in pain sensitivity and pain modulation, measured by quantitative sensory testing (QST), can be used to predict pain ratings after total knee replacement (TKR), but there has been little work targeted at identifying which QST variables are most predictive of persistent post-TKR pain outcomes. Our ongoing multisite study evaluated a total of 103 OA patients that were scheduled for TKR surgery (mean age = 65.8). QST was assessed prior to surgery, and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was used to classify patients into groups with low/ minimal pain, or with clinically significant pain (i.e., scores of {\$} 3/10 on the BPI Pain Severity/Interference scales) at 3-4 months following surgery. QST variables included pressure pain thresholds measured at multiple body sites, heat pain threshold and tolerance, cold pain tolerance and cold pain ratings, temporal summation of mechanical pain, conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and responses to deep-tissue mechanical pain. Results revealed that cold pain after-sensations, a measure of central pain-facilitatory processes, were the single best predictor (p{\textless} .01) of clinically significant post-operative pain at 3-4 months post-surgery. Other commonly-studied QST measures such as pressure pain thresholds were generally non-predictive. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individual variability in dynamic measures of pain modulation, specifically pain-facilitatory processes, when investigating psychophysical predictors of post-operative pain outcomes.},

abstract = {BackgroundPrior investigations have suggested that physician-related factors may contribute to differential use of TKA among women and ethnic minorities. We sought to evaluate the effect of surgeon bias on recommendations for TKA. Questions/purposeUsing an experimental approach with standardized patient scenarios, we sought to evaluate surgeon recommendations regarding TKA, specifically to determine whether recommendations for TKA are influenced by (1) patient race, and (2) patient sex. MethodsWe developed four computerized scenarios for all combinations of race (white or black) and sex (male or female) for otherwise similar patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Patients gave an orthopaedic history of 2 years worsening pain with decreased functional status and failure of oral antiinflammatory medications and corticosteroid intraarticular injections. Orthopaedic surgeons attending the 2012 annual meetings of the New York State Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons were recruited for the study. Surgeons passing an open recruitment table at each meeting were asked to participate. Of the 1111 surgeons in attendance at either meeting, 113 (10.2{\%}) participated in the study. All participants viewed the “control” patient's story (white male) and were randomized to view one of the three “experimental” scenarios (white female, black male, black female). After viewing each scenario, the participants were anonymously asked whether they would recommend TKA. An a priori power analysis showed that 112 participants were needed to detect a 15{\%} difference in the likelihood of recommending surgery for white versus nonwhite patients in the test scenarios evaluated with 90{\%} power at a level of significance of 0.05. ResultsOf the 39 surgeons who viewed the white male plus black female scenario, there were 33 (85{\%}) concordant responses (TKA offered to both patients) and six discordant responses (TKA offered to only one of the patients), with no effect of patient race and sex (p = 0.99). Of the 37 surgeons who viewed the white male plus black male scenario, there were 33 (89{\%}) concordant responses and four discordant responses, with no effect of patient race (p = 0.32). Of the 37 surgeons who viewed the white male plus white female scenario, there were 30 (77{\%}) concordant responses and seven discordant responses, with no effect of patient sex (p = 0.71). ConclusionAfter orthopaedic surgeons viewed video scenarios of patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis, patient race and sex were not associated with a different likelihood of a surgical recommendation. Our findings support the notion that patient race and sex may be less influential on decision making when there are strong clinical data to support a decision. Physician bias may have a greater effect on decision making in situations where the indications for surgery are less clear.},

The study was based on data from the 2000 Danish Health and Morbidity Survey. As part of a representative National random sample of 16,684 individuals ({\textgreater}16 years of age), 10,066 took part in an interview and completed a self-administered questionnaire. Cancer patients were excluded. The interview and the self-administered questionnaire included questions on chronic/long-lasting pain ({\textgreater}6 months), health-related quality of life (SF-36), use of the health care system, functional capabilities, satisfaction with medical pain treatment and regular or continuous use of medications. Participants reporting pain were divided into opioid and non-opioid users. The analyses were adjusted for age, gender, concomitant use of anxiolytics and antidepressants and pain intensity. Pain relief, quality of life and functional capacity among opioid users were compared with non-opioid users. Opioid usage was significantly associated with reporting of moderate/severe or very severe pain, poor self-rated health, not being engaged in employment, higher use of the health care system, and a negative influence on quality of life as registered in all items in SF-36. Because of the cross-sectional nature causative relationships cannot be ascertained. However, it is remarkable that opioid treatment of long-term/chronic non-cancer pain does not seem to fulfil any of the key outcome opioid treatment goals: pain relief, improved quality of life and improved functional capacity. ?? 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {Objectives: Pain is the hallmark symptom of sickle cell disease (SCD), yet the types of pain that these patients experience, and the underlying mechanisms, have not been well characterized. The study purpose was to determine the safety and utility of a mechanical and thermal quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol and the feasibility of utilizing neuropathic pain questionnaires among adults with SCD. Methods: A convenience sample (N = 25, 18 women, mean age 38.5 ± 12.5 [20-58 years]) completed self-report pain and quality-of-life tools. Subjects also underwent testing with the TSA-II NeuroSensory Analyzer and calibrated von Frey microfilaments. Results: We found that the QST protocol was safe and did not stimulate a SCD pain crisis. There was evidence of central sensitization (n = 15), peripheral sensitization (n = 1), a mix of central and peripheral sensitization (n = 8), or no sensitization (n = 1). The neuropathic pain self-report tools were feasible with evidence of construct validity; 40{\%} of the subjects reported S-LANSS scores that were indicative of neuropathic pain and had evidence of central, peripheral or mixed sensitization. Discussion: The QST protocol can be safely conducted in adults with SCD and provides evidence of central or peripheral sensitization, which is consistent with a neuropathic component to SCD pain. These findings are novel, warrant a larger confirmatory study, and indicate the need for normative QST data from African American adults and older adults.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) who have worse physical function preoperatively achieve a postoperative status that is similar to that of patients with better preoperative function. METHODS: This study surveyed an observational cohort of 379 consecutive patients with definite OA who were without other inflammatory joint diseases and were undergoing either total hip or knee replacement in a US (Boston) and a Canadian (Montreal) referral center. Questionnaires on health status (the Short Form 36 and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) were administered preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Physical function and pain due to OA were deemed the most significant outcomes to study. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two patients returned their questionnaires. Patients in the 2 centers were comparable in age, sex, time to surgery, and proportion of hip/knee surgery. The Boston group had more education, lower comorbidity, and more cemented knee prostheses. Patients undergoing hip or knee replacement in Montreal had lower preoperative physical function and more pain than their Boston counterparts. In patients with lower preoperative physical function, function and pain were not improved postoperatively to the level achieved by those with higher preoperative function. This was most striking in patients undergoing total knee replacement. CONCLUSION: Surgery performed later in the natural history of functional decline due to OA of the knee, and possibly of the hip, results in worse postoperative functional status.},

abstract = {The development of patient profiles to subgroup individuals on a variety of variables has gained attention as a potential means to better inform clinical decision-making. Patterns of pain sensitivity response specific to quantitative sensory testing (QST) modality have been demonstrated in healthy subjects. It has not been determined if these patterns persist in a knee osteoarthritis population. In a sample of 218 participants, 19 QST measures along with pain, psychological factors, self-reported function, and quality of life were assessed prior to total knee arthroplasty. Component analysis was used to identify commonalities across the 19 QST assessments to produce standardized pain sensitivity factors. Cluster analysis then grouped individuals that exhibited similar patterns of standardized pain sensitivity component scores. The QST resulted in four pain sensitivity components: heat, punctate, temporal summation, and pressure. Cluster analysis resulted in five pain sensitivity profiles: a "low pressure pain" group, an "average pain" group, and three "high pain" sensitivity groups who were sensitive to different modalities (punctate, heat, and temporal summation). Pain and function differed between pain sensitivity profiles, along with sex distribution; however no differences in OA grade, medication use, or psychological traits were found. Residualizing QST data by age and sex resulted in similar components and pain sensitivity profiles. Further, these profiles are surprisingly similar to those reported in healthy populations suggesting that individual differences in pain sensitivity are a robust finding even in an older population with significant disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: At the request of the European Commission and in the framework of the European Machinery Directive, research was performed in five different laboratories to develop specifications for surface temperature limit values for the short-term accidental touching of the fingertip with cold surfaces.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data were collected in four laboratories with a total of 20 males and 20 females performing a grand total of 1655 exposures. Each touched polished blocks of aluminium, stainless steel, nylon-6 and wood using the distal phalanx of the index finger with a contact force of 1.0, 2.9 and 9.8 N, at surface temperatures from +2 to -40 degrees C for a maximum duration of 120 s. Conditions were selected in order to elicit varying rates of skin cooling upon contact. Contact temperature (TC) of the fingertip was measured over time using a T-type thermocouple.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A database obtained from the experiments was collated and analysed to characterize fingertip contact cooling across a range of materials and surface temperatures. The database was subsequently used to develop a predictive model to describe the contact duration required for skin contact temperature to reach the physiological criteria of onset of pain (15 degrees C), onset of numbness (7 degrees C) and onset of frostbite risk (0 degrees C).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The data reflect the strong link between the risk of skin damage and the thermal properties of the material touched. For aluminium and steel, skin temperatures of 0 degrees C occurs within 2-6 s at surface temperatures of -15 degrees C. For non-metallic surfaces, onset of numbness occurs within 15-65 s of contact at -35 degrees C and onset of cold pain occurs within 5 s of contact at -20 degrees C. The predictive model subsequently developed was a non-linear exponential expression also reflecting the effects of material thermal properties and initial temperature. This model provides information for the protection of workers against the risk of cold injury by establishing the temperature limits of cold touchable surfaces for a broad range of materials, and it is now proposed as guidance values in a new international standard.},

abstract = {Objectives: To describe practice patterns in the management of osteoporosis after fragility fracture. Methods: Systematic review of articles in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases (1996 to February 2005). Diagnostic outcomes included clinical osteoporosis diagnoses, laboratory tests, and bone density scans. Treatment outcomes included initiation of calcium, vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, raloxifene and falls assessments. Results: Thirty-five studies met our inclusion criteria and demonstrated that adults who experience fragility fracture are not receiving osteoporosis management. An osteoporosis diagnosis was reported in 1 to 45{\%} of patients with fractures; laboratory tests were ordered for 1 to 49{\%} and 1 to 32{\%} of patients had bone density scans. Calcium/vitamin D and pharmacological therapy was reported in 2 to 62{\%} and 1 to 65{\%} of patients, respectively. Osteoporosis treatment was recommended more often in women than men, and more often in patients with vertebral fractures than in patients with nonvertebral fractures. Older patients were more likely to be diagnosed with osteoporosis, but treatment was more likely in younger patients. A history of prior fracture was reported in 7 to 67{\%} of patients. Between 1 and 22{\%} of patients had a subsequent fracture during follow-up periods of 6 months to 5 years. Falls assessments were not often reported; when they were, they were infrequently performed. A greater proportion of patients were diagnosed/treated during follow-up studies than in studies evaluating diagnosis/treatment on discharge from acute care. Conclusions: The majority of individuals who sustain fragility fractures are not receiving adequate osteoporosis management. Future research should address barriers to appropriate management and the efficacy of implementation strategies designed to close the osteoporosis care gap. Relevance: This article is of particular importance to health care professionals who provide care for patients with fragility fracture. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQL) has become increasingly common in health services research. Whilst useful, its focus on behaviour, capacities and activities means that it remains relatively specific. This paper explores the possibility of extending the evaluation of health by considering the concept of patients' expectations. DESIGN: In-depth and semi-structured interviews were used to explore the concept of expectations from the patients' perspective. Patients' expectations were then used in the construction of a two-part questionnaire. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Expectations were explored with a group of 33 cardiac patients. The resulting questionnaire was given to 400 cardiac patients in a large teaching hospital in London. RESULTS: Patients identified a range of expectations which related to their health and seemed to represent the desired results of their hospital stay. Comparison of the content of patient expectations with a commonly used generic measure of HRQL, the Short-Form 36 (SF-36), found some overlap but indicated that patients seemed to adopt a broader approach to their health. Expectations that patients identified were used to construct two scales to measure expectations and their evaluation. The internal consistency of these scales was 0.82 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study indicates the potential complexity of the concept of expectations and the need for further exploration. It also demonstrates the feasibility of constructing standardized scales to measure patient expectations. Whilst conceptually different from HRQL such standardized expectations scales could provide a useful adjunct to HRQL measurement and provide a meaningful context for the interpretation of HRQL data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although it is recognized that medical and surgical procedures may lead to persistent postoperative pain, predicting which patients are at risk for developing chronic pain presents an ongoing challenge. Clinical observations indicate that similar invasive procedures associated with consequent peripheral tissue damage can cause a wide range of pain experience. This broad variability is likely a consequence of the diversity in the central pain processing of the peripherally generated noxious stimulation. Therefore, advanced psychophysical measures that dynamically represent central pain modulation mechanisms may be used to determine an individual's susceptibility to developing persistent postoperative pain. This review highlights how, and to what extent, preoperative experimental pain testing can be utilized in predicting persistent postoperative pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Conflicting findings emerged regarding the role of traditional experimental pain tests, including pain threshold, supra-threshold magnitude estimation, and tolerance in the prediction of acute postoperative pain. Less efficient endogenous modulation and greater sensitization, as preoperatively assessed by advanced experimental pain tests, were associated with higher persistent postoperative pain scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: The preoperative identification of individuals who have enhanced pain sensitivity and are at risk for developing persistent postoperative pain is important to providing them with better treatment that is specifically tailored to their altered pain modulation, as represented psychophysically.},

abstract = {Central mechanisms related to referred muscle pain and temporal summation of muscular nociceptive activity are facilitated in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients. The present study assessed the effects of an NMDA-antagonist (ketamine) on these central mechanisms. FMS patients received either i.v. placebo or ketamine (0.3 mg/kg, Ketalar((R))50{\%} decrease in pain intensity at rest by active drug on two consecutive VAS assessments). Fifteen out of 17 ketamine-responders were included in the second part of the study. Before and after ketamine or placebo, experimental local and referred pain was induced by intramuscular (i.m.) infusion of hypertonic saline (0.7 ml, 5{\%}) into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. The saline-induced pain intensity was assessed on an electronic VAS, and the distribution of pain drawn by the subject. In addition, the pain threshold (PT) to i.m. electrical stimulation was determined for single stimulus and five repeated (2 Hz, temporal summation) stimuli. The pressure PT of the TA muscle was determined, and the pressure PT and pressure pain tolerance threshold were determined at three bilaterally located tenderpoints (knee, epicondyle, and mid upper trapezius). VAS scores of pain at rest were progressively reduced during ketamine infusion compared with placebo infusion. Pain intensity (area under the VAS curve) to the post-drug infusion of hypertonic saline was reduced by ketamine (-18. 4+/-0.3{\%} of pre-drug VAS area) compared with placebo (29.9+/-18.8{\%}, P{\textless}0.02). Local and referred pain areas were reduced by ketamine (-12. 0+/-14.6{\%} of pre-drug pain areas) compared with placebo (126.3+/-83. 2{\%}, P{\textless}0.03). Ketamine had no significant effect on the PT to single i.m. electrical stimulation. However, the span between the PT to single and repeated i.m. stimuli was significantly decreased by the ketamine (-42.3+/-15.0{\%} of pre-drug PT) compared with placebo (50. 5+/-49.2{\%}, P{\textless}0.03) indicating a predominant effect on temporal summation. Mean pressure pain tolerance from the three paired tenderpoints was increased by ketamine (16.6+/-6.2{\%} of pre-drug thresholds) compared with placebo (-2.3+/-4.9{\%}, P{\textless}0.009). The pressure PT at the TA muscle was increased after ketamine (42.4+/-9. 2{\%} of pre-drug PT) compared with placebo (7.0+/-6.6{\%}, P{\textless}0.011). The present study showed that mechanisms involved in referred pain, temporal summation, muscular hyperalgesia, and muscle pain at rest were attenuated by the NMDA-antagonist in FMS patients. It suggested a link between central hyperexcitability and the mechanisms for facilitated referred pain and temporal summation in a sub-group of the fibromyalgia syndrome patients. Whether this is specific for FMS patients or a general phenomena in painful musculoskeletal disorders is not known.},

abstract = {Background: The use of conditioning pain modulation (CPM) is hampered by poor reproducibility and lack of user-independent paradigms. This study refined the CPM paradigm by applying user-independent cuff algometry. Methods: In 20 subjects, the CPM effect of conditioning with cuff stimulation on the arm was investigated by pain test stimuli on the contralateral leg before and in parallel with different cuff conditionings (10, 30, 60 kPa/60 s; 30, 60 kPa/10 s). As test stimulus, another cuff was inflated (1 kPa/s) until the subjects detected the pain tolerance threshold (PTT) during which the pain detection threshold (PDT) and the pressure at a pain intensity of 6 cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (PVAS6) were extracted. For comparison, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) as test stimuli were recorded by the user-dependent handheld pressure algometry. Combinations of cuff locations for conditioning (pain intensity standardized) and contralateral test stimuli were additionally evaluated (leg–arm, leg–leg, arm–thigh). The test–retest reliability in two sessions 1 month apart was assessed in five CPM protocols. Results: In all protocols, the PDT, PVAS6 and PTT increased during conditioning compared with baseline (p {\textless} 0.05). The CPM effect (i.e. conditioning minus baseline) for PVAS6, PTT and PPT increased for increasing conditioning intensities (p {\textless} 0.05). The CPM effects were not significantly different for changes in conditioning durations or conditioning/ test stimulus locations. In two sessions, the CPM effects for PVAS6 and PTT assessed after 60 s of conditioning on the leg/thigh showed the highest intra-class correlations (0.47–0.73), where they were 0.04–0.6 for PPTs. Conclusions: The user-independent cuff algometry is reliable for CPM assessment and for supra-pain threshold test stimuli better than the user-dependent technology. Significance: A user-independent CPM technique where the conditioning is controlled by one cuff stimulation, and the test-stimulus is provided by another cuff stimulation. This study shows that cuff algometry is reliable for CPM assessment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The modest association between radiographic joint damage and pain in osteoarthritis (OA) has led to the suggestion of facilitated central pain processing. This study evaluated the importance of ongoing tissue pathology in the maintenance of enhanced central pain processing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Pain assessment was performed on 48 patients with symptomatic knee OA and 21 sex- and age-matched pain-free healthy control subjects. Twenty of the OA patients subsequently underwent total knee replacement surgery and were reassessed. Pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs) were recorded using a pressure algometer (both over and distant from the knee) and a double-chamber inflatable cuff mounted around the calf. Spatial summation was assessed by relating PPTs using the dual- and single-chamber cuff. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was assessed by recording the increase in PPT in response to experimental arm pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PPTs at the knee and at sites away from the knee were reduced in OA patients as compared with healthy pain-free control subjects (P {\textless} 0.0001). Cuff PPTs were decreased in OA patients as compared with the healthy controls (P {\textless} 0.05), who also exhibited a greater degree of spatial summation (P {\textless} 0.05). Whereas an elevation of PPTs was noted in the healthy controls in response to experimental arm pain (P {\textless} 0.0001), no such CPM was observed in the OA patients. Following joint replacement in the OA patients, there was a reduction in the widespread mechanical hyperesthesia, along with normalization of spatial summation ratios and restoration of CPM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The widespread hyperesthesia and enhanced spatial summation observed in OA patients imply sensitized central pain mechanisms together with the loss of CPM. Normalization of the results following joint replacement implies that these central pain processes are maintained by peripheral input.},

abstract = {The aim of this Review is to give a short presentation of the manifestations, assessment methods, and mechanisms underlying localized and widespread musculoskeletal pain, deep somatic tissue hyperalgesia and chronification. Hyperalgesia can be explained by increased pain sensitivity of nociceptors located in deep tissue (peripheral sensitization) or by increased responses from dorsal horn neurons (central sensitization). The spreading of pain and sensitization is related to increased synaptic activity in central neurons and to changes in descending control from supraspinal centers. Manifestations related to the different aspects of sensitization can be assessed quantitatively using sensory tests, such as pressure algometry (quantitative palpation) and cuff-algometry. Repeated pressure stimulation can evaluate the degree of temporal summation, which is a proxy for the level of central sensitization, as is expanded referred muscle pain area. The transition of acute localized musculoskeletal pain into chronic widespread pain is related to the progression of peripheral and central sensitization. This sensitization for the chronification of pain should be assessed by adequate pain biomarkers. Furthermore, pain prevention should target early intervention strategies and new anti-hyperalgesic compounds should be developed.},

abstract = {Chronic musculoskeletal pain is linked with sensitization, and standardized methods for assessment are needed. This study investigated (1) the test-retest reliability of computer-controlled cuff-pressure algometry (pain thresholds and temporal pain summation) on the arm and leg and (2) conditioned pain modulation (CPM) assessed by cuff algometry. The influences of age and gender were evaluated. On 2 different days, cuff pain threshold (cPPT), cuff pain tolerance (cPTT), and temporal summation of pain (TSP) by visual analog scale scores to 10 repeated cuff stimulations at cPTT intensity, as well as pressure pain threshold with handheld pressure algometry, were assessed in 136 healthy subjects. In one session, cuff pain sensitivity was also assessed before and after cold pressor-induced CPM. Good-to-excellent intraclass correlations (0.60-0.90) were demonstrated for manual and cuff algometry, and no systematic bias between sessions was found for cPPT, cPTT, and TSP on the leg and for cPTT and TSP on the arm. Cuff pressure pain threshold and cPTT were higher in men compared with women (P {\textless} 0.05). Middle-aged subjects had higher pressure pain threshold, but lower cPPT and cPTT, compared with younger subjects (P {\textless} 0.05). Temporal summation of pain was increased in women compared with men (P {\textless} 0.05). Cuff algometry was sensitive to CPM demonstrated as increased cPPT and cPTT and reduced TSP (P {\textless} 0.05). Reliability and sensitivity of computer-controlled cuff algometry for pain assessment is comparable with manual pressure algometry and constitutes a user-independent method for assessment of pain. Difference in age-related pain sensitivity between manual and cuff algometry should be further investigated.},

abstract = {A 5-year experience with 562 carotid endarterectomies, using electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and selective shunting, was reviewed. EEG changes occurred in 102 patients (18{\%}). The frequency of EEG changes, as related to cerebral vascular symptoms, was as follows: transient ischemic attacks, seven per cent (19/259); completed strokes, 37{\%} (36/98); vertebral basilar insufficiency, 24{\%} (32/135); asymptomatic, 21{\%} (15/71). Patients with contralateral carotid occlusion exhibited EEG changes in 37{\%} (28/76) of operations. Fifteen patients suffered perioperative strokes (2.6{\%}). Nine of the 15 were associated with a technical problem of either thrombosis of the internal carotid artery (five) or emboli (four). Technical problems were more common when shunts were used (five per cent) than when they were not (0.9{\%}). Patients who suffered strokes prior to surgery were more at risk to develop a perioperative stroke (three per cent) than those not suffering prior strokes (0.3{\%}). The EEG did not change in three patients who had lacunar infarcts prior to surgery and who awoke with a worsened deficit. Our series does not clearly establish the advantages of EEG monitoring, which is expensive (+375/patient) and may not detect ischemia in all areas of the brain. However, the use of shunts may introduce a risk of stroke due to technical error that is equal or greater than the risk of stroke due to hemodynamic ischemia. Since the need for protection is unpredictable by angiographic or clinical criteria, the benefit of EEG monitoring may be in reducing the incidence of shunting in those patients whose tracing remains normal after clamping. The decision to shunt, however, when there is electrical dysfunction after carotid clamping should be based not only on the EEG but also on the clinical signs and computed tomography (CT) scan. Our data does not show a net benefit in selective shunting unless the patient has sustained a stroke prior to surgery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite the recent advances in the understanding of pain mechanisms and the introduction of new drugs and new techniques in the postoperative management, pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is still an unresolved issue. It affects the quality of life and rehabilitation of an important percentage of patients undergoing TKA. The aim of this narrative review was to give an overview on pain mechanisms and multimodal pain management.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A review of all peer-reviewed articles on pain after knee arthroplasty was performed by two reviewers. Recent articles on incisional pain mechanisms were included because of their importance in the understanding of postsurgical pain. Search was performed in Pubmed, Cochrane and Google Scholar data bases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Postsurgical pain mechanisms are based on both local and systemic inflammatory reactions. Peri-operative pain management starts with the anaesthetic technique and resides on a multimodal analgesia regimen. New concepts, drugs and techniques have shown their efficacy in reducing the severity of acute postoperative pain and the risk of developing chronic pain after TKA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This narrative review offers a clear overview of pain mechanism after knee arthroplasty and an understanding on how multimodal pain management can reduce the intensity and duration of pain after knee arthroplasty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Cost effectiveness is an increasingly important factor in today's healthcare environment, and selection of arthroplasty implant is not exempt from such concerns. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) are the typical tool for this type of evaluation. Using this methodology, joint arthroplasty has been shown to be cost effective; however, studies directly comparing differing prostheses are lacking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data was gathered in a single-centre prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing the outcome of modern and traditional knee implants, using the Short Form 6 dimensional (SF-6D) score and quality adjusted life year (QALY) methodology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There was significant improvement in the SF-6D score for both groups at one year (p {\textless} 0.0001). The calculated overall life expectancy for the study cohort was 15.1 years, resulting in an overall QALY gain of 2.144 (95{\%} CI 1.752-2.507). The modern implant group demonstrated a small improvement in SF-6D score compared to the traditional design at one year (0.141 versus 0.143, p = 0.94). This difference resulted in the modern implant costing {\pounds}298 less per QALY at one year.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that modern implant technology does not influence the cost-effectiveness of TKA using the SF-6D and QALY methodology. This type of analysis however assesses health status, and is not sensitive to joint specific function. Evolutionary design changes in implant technology are thus unlikely to influence QALY analysis following joint replacement, which has important implications for implant procurement.},

abstract = {The International Association for the Study of Pain (ISAP) describes pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage". Pain is the sensation that usually arises when noxious stimulus causes real or potential damage to bodily tissue. The neural encoding and further processing elicited by such stimuli is called nociception. Pain can be essentially divided into two categories: adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protecting organism from injury. Contrary, maladaptive pain is an expression of the pathologic operation of nervous system. Chronic pain in humans has been arbitrarily defined as pain lasting for more than 6 months. It is not only results from prolonged sensitization of nociceptive neurons but also from influence of social and psychological factors.},

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of pain hypervigilance to clinical pain severity and experimental pain sensitivity in persons with symptomatic knee OA. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 168 adults with symptomatic knee OA. Quantitative sensory testing was used to measure sensitivity to heat pain, pressure pain, and cold pain, as well as temporal summation of heat pain, a marker of central sensitization. RESULTS: Pain hypervigilance was associated with greater clinical pain severity, as well as greater pressure pain. Pain hypervigilance was also a significant predictor of temporal summation of heat pain. CONCLUSIONS: Pain hypervigilance may be an important contributor to pain reports and experimental pain sensitivity among persons with knee OA.},

abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been used to investigate how the brain processes noxious stimuli in osteoarthritis (OA) and to identify the cortical location of pain perception. However, no consensus has been reached regarding brain activity associated with pain-induced conditions in OA patients. We examined cerebral responses using intra-epidermal electrical stimulation of the knee in knee OA patients. To replicate the pain of knee OA in terms of predictability, acute pain generated by electrical stimulation was provided simultaneously with displayed images in this study. We used fMRI to identify differences in response between healthy subjects and knee OA patients and explored the modulating cortico-subcortical and cortico-cortical pathways using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Our results show that chronic pain results in a different brain activation profile in the DLPFC and the pain matrix in knee OA patients. Abnormal brain connectivity between the DLPFC and the pain matrix is induced by chronic pain in knee OA patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: One hundred and eight patients with varus gonarthrosis were treated with high tibial osteotomy (HTO) in 2001. Fifty one patients received an open wedge osteotomy by using the 'Puddu' plate and 57 patients received a Coventry-type closing wedge osteotomy. For both groups the follow-up examination period was 22.5 months (253-1009 days). MATERIAL AND METHODS: To evaluate the study, radiological and subjective criteria as well as the Lysholm and the Tegner Activity Score were used. Altogether 84 {\%} of the patients were included in the follow-up examination study. RESULTS: In both groups a significant improvement of both scores were achieved. Both methods obtained safe and reproducible results for the correction considering the different operation techniques. There were no differences in outcome between the two methods. Satisfactory results were also achieved for early arthrosis of the femoropatellar and the lateral compartment. CONCLUSION: Open and closed wedge HTOs obtain significant improvement in patients with medial osteoarthritis of the knee. Using the right technique is very important for good results. For stabilization of the medial ligament we recommend the open wedge osteotomy. The patient should be informed about the routine removal of the metal plate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE$\backslash$nUp to 20{\%} of patients experience long-term pain and dissatisfaction following knee replacement. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with persistent pain following knee replacement and their implications for patient satisfaction. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN$\backslash$nA case-controlled analysis compared patients with established persistent pain with patients who were pain-free. 2:1 frequency matching for age, gender, time from surgery and prosthesis was performed. 1310 patients were approached and 100 patients with persistent pain and 200 matched pain-free controls were included. Variables assessed included mechanical, biological, psychosocial and generalised factors. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nThe study found that the degree of dissatisfaction experienced by the patient with persistent pain following knee replacement affected the factors associated with pain. In the most dissatisfied patients, pain was associated with instability in the coronal plane (OR 19.8, 95{\%} CI 3.8–104.0), stiffness (OR 6.4, 95{\%} CI 2.3–18.4) and negative social support (OR 3.3, 95{\%} CI 1.1–10.0). In patients who were less dissatisfied, pain was associated with patellofemoral problems (OR 10.3, 95{\%} CI 3.6–29.6), elevated BMI (OR 2.8, 95{\%} CI 1.4–5.7) and reduced local pain thresholds (OR 4.4, 95{\%} CI 2.0–9.6). Depression (OR 13.6, 95{\%} CI 1.9–96.6) and presence of proximal tibial tenderness (OR 23.5 95{\%} CI 7.8–70.7) were strongly associated with pain regardless of level of satisfaction. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS$\backslash$nPatients with persistent pain after knee replacement are dissatisfied. This study identifies factors associated with the worst pain outcomes, which lead to the greatest levels of dissatisfaction. Particular efforts with a holistic multidisciplinary approach should be focused towards these “red flag” factors in order to minimise persistent pain after knee replacement.},

abstract = {Background: Economic evaluations of health interventions pose a particular challenge for reporting because substantial information must be conveyed to allow scrutiny of study findings. Despite a growth in published reports, existing reporting guidelines are not widely adopted. There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user-friendly manner. A checklist is one way to help authors, editors, and peer reviewers use guidelines to improve reporting. Objective: The task force's overall goal was to provide recommendations to optimize the reporting of health economic evaluations. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines into one current, useful reporting guidance. The CHEERS Elaboration and Explanation Report of the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices Task Force facilitates the use of the CHEERS statement by providing examples and explanations for each recommendation. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. Methods: The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. Previously published checklists or guidance documents related to reporting economic evaluations were identified from a systematic review and subsequent survey of task force members. A list of possible items from these efforts was created. A two-round, modified Delphi Panel with representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, and government, as well as the editorial community, was used to identify a minimum set of items important for reporting from the larger list. Results: Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed, with some specific recommendations for single study-based and model-based economic evaluations. The final recommendations are subdivided into six main categories: 1) title and abstract, 2) introduction, 3) methods, 4) results, 5) discussion, and 6) other. The recommendations are contained in the CHEERS statement, a user-friendly 24-item checklist. The task force report provides explanation and elaboration, as well as an example for each recommendation. The ISPOR CHEERS statement is available online via Value in Health or the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines Good Reporting Practices - CHEERS Task Force webpage (http://www.ispor.org/ TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). Conclusions: We hope that the ISPOR CHEERS statement and the accompanying task force report guidance will lead to more consistent and transparent reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate wider dissemination and uptake of this guidance, we are copublishing the CHEERS statement across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups to consider endorsing the CHEERS statement.

abstract = {Objectives: To identify the optimal exercise program characterized by type and intensity of exercise, length of exercise program, duration of individual supervised sessions, and number of sessions per week for reducing pain and patient-reported disability in knee osteoarthritis. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were combined using a random effects model. Study-level covariates were applied in meta-regression analyses in order to reduce the between study heterogeneity. Results: Forty-eight trials were included. Similar effects in reducing pain were found for aerobic, resistance and performance exercise (SMD: 0.67, 0.62 and 0.48; P=0.733). These single type exercise programs were more efficacious than mixing different exercise types (SMD: 0.61 vs. 0.16; P{\textless}0.001). The effect of aerobic exercise on pain relief increased with a larger number of supervised sessions (slope: 0.022 [95{\%}CI: 0.002; 0.043]. More pain reduction occurred with quadriceps-specific exercise compared with lower-limb exercise (SMD: 0.85 vs. 0.39; P=0.005); and when supervised exercise was performed at least three times a week (SMD: 0.68 vs. 0.41; P=0.017). No impact of intensity, duration of individual sessions or patient characteristics was found. Similar results were found analyzing the effect on patient-reported disability. Conclusion: Optimal exercise programs for knee OA should have one aim and focus on improving aerobic capacity, quadriceps muscle strength or lower extremity performance. For best effect, the program should be supervised and carried out three times a week. Such programs have similar effect regardless of patient characteristics, including radiographic severity and baseline pain. {\textcopyright} 2013 American College of Rheumatology.},

abstract = {MANGLER EN S{\O}GEPROTOKOL strenght of skin due to balliastic stimulation Hydrogels prepared from water solutions containing 10-20 mass{\%} gelatine are generally accepted muscle tissue simulants in terminal ballistic research. They, however, do not have a surface layer which simulates the effect of human skin. The purpose of this research was to find a suitable skin simulant for enhancing the testing fidelity and the credibility of the results with gelatine-based materials when assessing the injury potential of not only high energy bullets, but also especially that of non-penetrating "less lethal" kinetic impact ammunition and relatively low energy ricochet fragments. A skin simulant also permits the simulation and assessment of exit wounds. The mechanical and ballistic properties of human skin and target simulant were established on the basis of results found in the literature. Some errors in these were found. The corrected values are included in this paper for comparison. The target values of the mechanical properties of the skin simulant were the following: threshold velocity $\nu$th = 94 ± 4 m/s, tensile strength 18 ± 2 N/mm2 and elongation at break 65 ± 5{\%}. A selection of synthetic and natural materials was evaluated as skin simulants by analysing their mechanical and ballistic properties. The results were compared to literature values obtained with human cadavers. The tests showed that the best skin simulant of the ones evaluated was semi-finished chrome tanned upholstery "crust" cowhide of 0.9-1.1 mm nominal thickness. Its threshold velocity was 90.7 m/s, tensile strength 20.89 ± 4.11 MPa and elongation at break 61 ± 9{\%}. These values are the same as the average values of human skin. Of the synthetic materials evaluated, 1 mm thick natural rubber can be used on impact side as a threshold velocity filter with some reservations although its theoretical threshold velocity is only 82.9 m/s. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {AIMS: Evaluation of effectiveness is connected with prevailing paradigms, and the breadth and perspective applied therein exhibit differences. Effectiveness refers to the extent to which a given intervention or service produces health outcomes in individuals to whom it is offered. The aim of this paper is to clarify the concept of effectiveness evaluation in health care and present the ways in which Finnish healthcare studies use the concept of effectiveness. METHODS: Through a systematic review of Finnish scientific journals in the healthcare research field, 25 original studies, 35 review articles, and 20 discussion papers were acquired. The inclusion criterion was that the word 'effectiveness' was presented in the title or abstract. RESULTS: In this study the effects of actions were evaluated through the process (outputs) or through the outcomes (harms and benefits). The word 'effectiveness' is widely used in healthcare research in Finland; mostly in studies of orthopaedics, health services research, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, and psychiatry, yet the concept was explicitly defined in only three papers. Most studies used both process and outcome measures. The outcome indicators were usually disease-specific. Papers presenting only process outputs clearly showed a health service producer's perspective. Health-related quality of life as an outcome indicator was rarely used. CONCLUSIONS: In Finnish healthcare studies, the concept of effectiveness was rarely defined and effectiveness measures were often vague or even nonexistent. The meaning of the term had to be interpreted from the study methodology, measures, and indicators.},

abstract = {Background and purpose - Pain sensitization may be one of the reasons for persistent pain after technically successful joint replacement. We analyzed how pain sensitization, as measured by quantitative sensory testing, relates preoperatively to joint function in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) scheduled for joint replacement. Patients and methods - We included 50 patients with knee OA and 49 with hip OA who were scheduled for joint replacement, and 15 control participants. Hip/knee scores, thermal and pressure detection, and pain thresholds were examined. Results - Median pressure pain thresholds were lower in patients than in control subjects: 4.0 (range: 0-10) vs. 7.8 (4-10) (p = 0.003) for the affected knee; 4.5 (2-10) vs. 6.8 (4-10) (p = 0.03) for the affected hip. Lower pressure pain threshold values were found at the affected joint in 26 of the 50 patients with knee OA and in 17 of the 49 patients with hip OA. The American Knee Society score 1 and 2, the Oxford knee score, and functional questionnaire of Hannover for osteoarthritis score correlated with the pressure pain thresholds in patients with knee OA. Also, Harris hip score and the functional questionnaire of Hannover for osteoarthritis score correlated with the cold detection threshold in patients with hip OA. Interpretation - Quantitative sensory testing appeared to identify patients with sensory changes indicative of mechanisms of central sensitization. These patients may require additional pain treatment in order to profit fully from surgery. There were correlations between the clinical scores and the level of sensitization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have identified clinical, psychosocial, patient characteristic, and perioperative variables that are associated with persistent postsurgical pain; however, the relative effect of these variables has yet to be quantified. The aim of the study was to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of predictor variables associated with persistent pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Included studies were required to measure predictor variables prior to or at the time of surgery, include a pain outcome measure at least 3 months post-TKA, and include a statistical analysis of the effect of the predictor variable(s) on the outcome measure. Counts were undertaken of the number of times each predictor was analysed and the number of times it was found to have a significant relationship with persistent pain. Separate meta-analyses were performed to determine the effect size of each predictor on persistent pain. Outcomes from studies implementing uni- and multivariable statistical models were analysed separately.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Thirty-two studies involving almost 30 000 patients were included in the review. Preoperative pain was the predictor that most commonly demonstrated a significant relationship with persistent pain across uni- and multivariable analyses. In the meta-analyses of data from univariate models, the largest effect sizes were found for: other pain sites, catastrophizing, and depression. For data from multivariate models, significant effects were evident for: catastrophizing, preoperative pain, mental health, and comorbidities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Catastrophizing, mental health, preoperative knee pain, and pain at other sites are the strongest independent predictors of persistent pain after TKA.},

abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent condition associated with pain, joint destruction and morbidity. Direct healthcare costs are 2 to 3 times higher than average costs for individuals of similar age and gender. Furthermore, utilisation and costs rise with age and disease duration. Managed care has become an increasingly popular way to organise and finance the delivery of healthcare. Studies comparing the quality of care in health maintenance organisations and fee-for-service settings have found few differences in outcomes, although reduced costs have been attributed to lower hospitalisation rates in patients with RA. We reviewed 10 studies of the direct costs of RA. In 1996 dollars, direct costs ranged from {\$}US 2,299 per person per year in Canada to {\$}US 13,549 in a US study focusing on patients who have been hospitalised only. Surprisingly, the contributions to direct costs--hospital care, medications and physician visits--remained relatively stable over time and the setting of care. Hospitalisation costs were the highest component of direct costs accounting, generally, for 60{\%} or more of costs while only approximately 10{\%} of patients with RA were hospitalised. The only exception was a managed care setting where hospitalisation costs were 16{\%} of total direct costs. In managed care settings, costs of medications were proportionately higher than in fee-for-service settings. We conclude that in studies of the direct costs of RA the components of costs have remained relatively stable over time. This may change with the development and growing use of new RA medications including cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors, interleukins, cytokines, treatments that inhibit tumour necrosis factor, and combination therapies. The effectiveness of managed care in controlling direct costs needs to be evaluated in more targeted studies.},

abstract = {It has been estimated that up to 54{\%} of the variance in postoperative pain experience may be predicted with preoperative pain responses to experimental stimuli, with suprathreshold heat pain as the most consistent test modality. This study aimed to explore whether 2 heat test paradigms could predict postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients scheduled for elective, unilateral, primary TKA under spinal anesthesia were consecutively included in this prospective, observational study. Perioperative analgesia was standardized for all patients. Outcomes were postoperative pain during walk: from 6 to 24 hours (primary), from postoperative day (POD) 1 to 7 (secondary), and from POD 14 to 30 (tertiary). Two preoperative tonic heat stimuli with 47 C were used; short (5 seconds) and long (7 minutes) stimulation upon which patients rated their pain response on an electronic visual analog scale. Multivariate stepwise linear and logistic regressions analyses were carried out, including 8 potential preoperative explanatory variables (among these anxiety, depression, preoperative pain, and pain catastrophizing) to assess pain response to preoperative heat pain stimulation as an independent predictor for postoperative pain. A total of 100 patients were included, and 3 were later excluded. A weak correlation [rho (95{\%} confidence interval); P value] was observed between pain from POD 1 to 7 and pain response to short [rho = 0.25(0.04 to 0.44); P =.02] and to long [rho = 0.27 (0.07 to 0.46); P =.01] heat pain stimulation. However, these positive correlations were not supported by the linear and logistic regression analyses, in which only anxiety, preoperative pain, and pain catastrophizing were significant explanatory variables (but with low R-squares; 0.05 to 0.08). Pain responses to 2 types of preoperative heat stimuli were not independent clinically relevant predictors for postoperative pain after TKA. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract = {Gabapentin has shown acute postoperative analgesic effects, but the optimal dose and procedure-specific benefits vs harm have not been clarified. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding study, 300 opioid-naive patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty were randomized (1:1:1) to either gabapentin 1300 mg/d (group A), gabapentin 900 mg/d (group B), or placebo (group C) daily from 2 hours preoperatively to postoperative day 6 in addition to a standardized multimodal analgesic regime. The primary outcome was pain upon ambulation 24 hours after surgery, and the secondary outcome was sedation 6 hours after surgery. Other outcomes were overall pain during well-defined mobilizations and at rest and sedation during the first 48 hours and from days 2-6, morphine use, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and nausea, vomiting, dizziness, concentration difficulty, headache, visual disturbances, and adverse reactions. Pain upon ambulation (visual analog scale, mean [95{\%} confidence interval]) 24 hours after surgery in group A vs B vs C was as follows: 41 [37-46] vs 41 [36-45] vs 42 [37-47], P = 0.93. Sedation (numeric rating scale, median [range]) 6 hours after surgery was as follows: 3.2 [0-10] vs 2.6 [0-9] vs 2.3 [0-9], the mean difference A vs C being 0.9 [0.2-1.7], P = 0.046. No between-group differences were observed in overall pain or morphine use the first 48 hours and from days 2-6. Sleep quality was better during the first 2 nights in group A and B vs C. Dizziness was more pronounced from days 2-6 in A vs C. More severe adverse reactions were observed in group A vs B and C. In conclusion, gabapentin may have a limited if any role in acute postoperative pain management of opioid-naive patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty and should not be recommended as a standard of care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative sensory testing (QST) allows precise characterization of sensory deficits and painful symptoms and may offer additional information on the pathophysiology of postoperative pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We evaluated 20 patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty clinically and with QST before surgery, at 1 and 4 days after surgery, and at 1 and 4 mo after surgery. The clinical evaluation included preoperative pain and inflammation of the operative knee, postoperative assessment of pain at rest and during movement (Visual Analog Scale score), cumulative morphine consumption, and circumference and temperature of both knees. QST included thermal and mechanical (pressure) pain threshold measurements and assessment of responses to suprathreshold stimuli. Brush-evoked allodynia was also evaluated. Measurements were taken on the operative knee, contralateral knee, and on the hand as a control site.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All patients had prolonged and severe pain before surgery and inflammation of the operative knee. Preoperative QST provided evidence of heat hyperalgesia in the inflammatory area on the operative knee, but absence of punctate or brush-evoked allodynia in the adjacent noninflamed area. Patients had intense postoperative pain, mostly induced by movement. Primary heat hyperalgesia was present on the operative knee on the first and fourth day after surgery, and was associated with punctate mechanical allodynia in the inflammatory area, but not in the adjacent noninflamed area. Postoperative morphine consumption was correlated with preoperative heat hyperalgesia (r = 0.63; P = 0.01). QST returned to baseline at the 4-mo evaluation. Only four patients had moderate knee pain induced by movement at that time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Heat hyperalgesia was the predominant QST symptom associated with perioperative pain after total knee arthroplasty, and was predictive of postoperative morphine consumption.},

abstract = {Backgrounds and Aims: Quantitative testing of patients' basal preoperative pain perception may be of clinical value if it accurately can predict magnitude of pain and requirement of analgesics after surgery. This article is a review of studies that have investigated the correlation between preoperative responses to experimental pain stimuli and clinical postoperative pain. The objective was to examine the predictive, statistical potential of these experimental pain stimuli and to evaluate their application in a scientific and clinical context. Methods: Studies were identified through systematic search in relevant databases. Results: Thirteen relevant studies were retrieved. Experimental stimulation methods were the cold-pressor test (n = 1), heated water immersion test (n = 1), phasic (n = 4), or tonic (n = 1) heat stimulation, cutaneous electrical stimulation (n = 4), pressure algometry (n = 1), punctate mechanical stimulation (n = 1), and induction of an inflammatory injury (n = 1). Pain sensitivity was evaluated by threshold (n = 12) or suprathreshold stimuli (n = 8), DNIC efficiency (n = 1), and/or pain tolerance (n = 3). The preoperative experimental tests could account for 5{\%} to 43{\%} of the variance in postoperative pain experience. Two of the studies indicated that an increase in preoperative pain sensitivity was associated with development of chronic pain following surgery. Conclusions: Preoperative psychophysical assessments methods are valuable tools in prediction of postoperative acute and chronic pain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Multiple mechanisms are involved in pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA). The painDETECT and Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) questionnaires screen for neuropathic pain and may also identify individuals with musculoskeletal pain who exhibit abnormal central pain processing. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate painDETECT and S-LANSS for classification agreement and fit to the Rasch model, and to explore their relationship to pain severity and pain mechanisms in OA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 192 patients with knee OA completed questionnaires covering different aspects of pain. Another group of 77 patients with knee OA completed questionnaires and underwent quantitative sensory testing for pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs). Agreement between painDETECT and S-LANSS was evaluated using kappa coefficients and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Rasch analysis of both questionnaires was conducted. Relationships between screening questionnaires and measures of pain severity or PPTs were calculated using correlations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PainDETECT and S-LANSS shared a stronger correlation with each other than with measures of pain severity. ROC curves identified optimal cutoff scores for painDETECT and S-LANSS to maximize agreement, but the kappa coefficient was low ($\kappa$ = 0.33-0.46). Rasch analysis supported the measurement properties of painDETECT but not those of S-LANSS. Higher painDETECT scores were associated with widespread reductions in PPTs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The data suggest that painDETECT assesses pain quality associated with augmented central pain processing in patients with OA. Although developed as a screening questionnaire, painDETECT may also function as a measure of characteristics that indicate augmented central pain processing. Agreement between painDETECT and S-LANSS for pain classification was low, and it is currently unknown which tool may best predict treatment outcome.},

abstract = {Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a standardized and formalized clinical sensitivity test. Testing describes a subjective (psychophysical) method that entails a cooperation of the person to be examined. Within its framework, calibrated stimuli are applied to capture perception and pain thresholds, thus providing information on the presence of sensory plus or minus signs. The presented QST battery imitates natural thermal or mechanical stimuli. The aim is to acquire symptom patterns of sensory loss (for the functioning of the thick and thin nerve fibers) as well as a gain of function (hyperalgesia, allodynia, hyperpathia) with a simultaneous detection of cutaneous and deep tissue sensibility. Most of the tested QST parameters are normally distributed only after a logarithmic transformation (secondary normal distribution)—except the number of paradoxical heat sensations, of cold and heat pain thresholds, and vibration detection thresholds. A complete QST profile can be measured within 1 h. QST is suitable not only for clinical trials but also in practice as a diagnostic method to characterize the function of the somatosensory system—from the peripheral nerve fiber receptor to the projection pathways to the brain.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of skin are important for a number of applications including surgery, dermatology, impact biomechanics and forensic science. In this study, we have investigated the influence of location and orientation on the deformation characteristics of 56 samples of excised human skin. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out at a strain rate of 0.012 s -1 on skin from the back. Digital Image Correlation was used for 2D strain measurement and a histological examination of the dermis was also performed. The mean ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was 21.6??8.4 MPa, the mean failure strain 54{\%}??17{\%}, the mean initial slope 1.18??0.88 MPa, the mean elastic modulus 83.3??34.9 MPa and the mean strain energy was 3.6??1.6 MJ/m 3. A multivariate analysis of variance has shown that these mechanical properties of skin are dependent upon the orientation of the Langer lines (P{\textless}0.0001-P=0.046). The location of specimens on the back was also found to have a significant effect on the UTS (P=0.0002), the elastic modulus (P=0.001) and the strain energy (P=0.0052). The histological investigation concluded that there is a definite correlation between the orientation of the Langer lines and the preferred orientation of collagen fibres in the dermis (P{\textless}0.001). The data obtained in this study will provide essential information for those wishing to model the skin using a structural constitutive model. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical experience suggests that patients with osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) experience more chronic complications after surgery compared with patients receiving primary TKA. This study aimed to investigate the difference in pain, mobility, and quality of life (QoL) in patients after revision TKA compared with patients after primary TKA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 99 OA patients after revision TKA surgery and 215 patients after primary TKA surgery were investigated in a cross-sectional study using: a pain description of current pain (non-existent, mild, moderate, severe, or unbearable), the pain intensity visual analogue scale, the Knee Society Score, and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International questionnaire.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen percent after primary TKA surgery and 47{\%} after revision TKA surgery experienced severe to unbearable chronic postoperative pain. After revision TKA surgery patients reported higher pain intensities during rest (P=0.039), while walking (P=0.008), and on average over the last 24 hours (P=0.050) compared with the patients after primary TKA surgery. Patients after revision TKA surgery had reduced walking distance (P=0.001), increased use of walking aids (P=0.015), and showed an overall decreased QoL (P{\textless}0.001) compared with patients after primary TKA surgery. No significant improvement was found in walking distance (P=0.448) for patients before revision TKA surgery compared with after revision TKA surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: More than twice as many patients have pain after revision surgery compared with patients after primary TKA. Patients after revision TKA surgery have reduced function, poorer QoL, and higher pain intensity compared with patients after primary TKA surgery.},

abstract = {Patients with knee osteoarthritis demonstrate decreased pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), facilitated temporal summation (TS) of pain, and decreased conditioned pain modulation (CPM) compared with healthy controls. This study aimed to correlate preoperative PPTs, TS, and CPM with the development of chronic postoperative pain after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. Knee pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]: 0-10), PPTs, TS, and CPM were collected before, 2 months, and 12 months after TKR. Patients were divided into a low-pain (VAS {\textless} 3) and a high-pain (VAS ??? 3) group based on their VAS 12 months after TKR. The high-pain group (N = 17) had higher pain intensities compared with the low-pain group (N = 61) before surgery (P = 0.009) and 12 months after surgery (P {\textless} 0.001). The PPTs of the low-pain groups were normalized for all measurement sites comparing presurgery with 12 months postsurgery (P {\textless} 0.05, contralateral arm: P = 0.059), which was not the case for the high-pain group. The low-pain group showed a functional inhibitory CPM preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.05), which was not found in the high-pain group. The high-pain group had higher facilitated TS preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively compared with the low-pain group (P {\textless} 0.05). Preoperative TS level correlated to 12-month postoperative VAS (R = 0.240, P = 0.037). Patients who developed moderate-to-severe pain had pronociceptive changes compared with patients who developed mild pain postsurgery. Preoperative TS level correlated with the postoperative pain intensity and may be a preoperative mechanistic predictor for the development of chronic postoperative pain in patients with osteoarthritis after TKR.},

abstract = {Chronic postoperative pain after total knee replacement (TKR) in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) implies clinical challenges. Widespread hyperalgesia, facilitated temporal summation of pain (TSP), and impaired conditioned pain modulation (CPM) have been found in painful KOA. This exploratory study investigated postoperative pain relief 12 months after TKR in 4 subgroups of patients preoperatively profiled by mechanistic quantitative sensory testing. In 103 patients with KOA, pressure pain detection threshold (PDT) and tolerance thresholds (PTT) were assessed at the lower leg using cuff algometry. Temporal summation of pain was measured as an increase in pain intensity scores during 10 repeated (2 seconds intervals) painful cuff stimuli. Conditioned pain modulation was calculated as the relative increase in PDT during painful conditioning stimulation. The grand averages of TSP and CPM were calculated and values below or above were used for subgrouping: facilitated TSP/impaired CPM (group A, N = 16), facilitated TSP/normal CPM (group B, N = 15), normal TSP/impaired CPM (group C, N = 44), and normal TSP/normal CPM (group D, N = 28). Clinical VAS pain intensity scores were collected before and 12 months after TKR surgery and the pain relief calculated. Less pain relief was found in group A (52.0{\%} ± 14.0{\%} pain relief) than in group B (81.1{\%} ± 3.5{\%}, P = 0.023) and group C (79.6{\%} ± 4.4{\%}, P = 0.007), but not group D (69.4{\%} ± 7.9{\%}, P = 0.087). Low preoperative PDT was associated with a less postoperative pain relief (R = -0.222, P = 0.034), whereas TSP or CPM alone showed no associations with postoperative pain relief. This explorative study indicated that patients with osteoarthritis with facilitated TSP together with impaired CPM are more vulnerable to experience less pain relief after TKR.},

Frequency weighting (ISO 5349) predicts little risk of injury for frequencies {\textgreater}500 HZ. Potentially damaging high frequencies abound in impact tool–generated shock waves. Methods: A rat tail impact vibration model was developed to deliver shock-wave vibration from a riveting hammer to simulate bucking bar exposure. Rat tails were vibrated continuously for 12 min. Tail flick withdrawal times were determined for noxious heat. Nerve trunks and skin were processed for light and electron microscopy. Results: Immediately after vibration, the tails were hyperalgesic and had disrupted myelinated axons, fragmented nerve endings, and mast-cell degranulation. By 4 days, the tails were hypoalgesic; nerve endings were lost in the skin. Conclusions: Shock-wave vibration causes severe nerve damage. Frequency weighting seriously underestimates the risk of nerve injury with impact tools. Muscle Nerve, 2011},

abstract = {This study determined preoperative predictors of movement and resting pain following total knee replacement (TKR). We hypothesized that younger patients with higher preoperative pain intensity, pain sensitivity, trait anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and depression would be more likely to experience higher postoperative movement pain than older patients with lower scores on these variables prior to surgery, and that predictors would be similar for resting pain. Demographics, analgesic intake, anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, resting pain, movement pain (ie, during active knee range of motion), and quantitative sensory tests were performed preoperatively on 215 participants scheduled for a unilateral TKR. On postoperative day 2, analgesic intake, resting pain, and movement pain were again assessed. Significant predictors of moderate or severe movement pain were higher preoperative movement pain, von Frey pain intensity, and heat pain threshold. People with severe movement pain preoperatively were 20 times more likely to have severe movement pain postoperatively. When the influence of preoperative movement pain was removed, depression became a predictor. Significant predictors of moderate to severe resting pain were higher preoperative resting pain, depression, and younger age. These results suggest that patients with higher preoperative pain and depression are more likely to have higher pain following TKR, and younger patients may have higher resting pain. Cutaneous pain sensitivity predicted movement pain but not resting pain, suggesting that mechanisms underlying movement pain are different from resting pain. Aggressive management of preoperative pain, pain sensitivity, and depression prior to surgery may facilitate postoperative recovery. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {The nationwide multicenter trials of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) aim to characterize the somatosensory phenotype of patients with neuropathic pain. For this purpose, we have implemented a standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol giving a complete profile for one region within 30 min. To judge plus or minus signs in patients we have now established age- and gender-matched absolute and relative QST reference values from 180 healthy subjects, assessed bilaterally over face, hand and foot. We determined thermal detection and pain thresholds including a test for paradoxical heat sensations, mechanical detection thresholds to von Frey filaments and a 64 Hz tuning fork, mechanical pain thresholds to pinprick stimuli and blunt pressure, stimulus/response-functions for pinprick and dynamic mechanical allodynia, and pain summation (wind-up ratio). QST parameters were region specific and age dependent. Pain thresholds were significantly lower in women than men. Detection thresholds were generally independent of gender. Reference data were normalized to the specific group means and variances (region, age, gender) by calculating z-scores. Due to confidence limits close to the respective limits of the possible data range, heat hypoalgesia, cold hypoalgesia, and mechanical hyperesthesia can hardly be diagnosed. Nevertheless, these parameters can be used for group comparisons. Sensitivity is enhanced by side-to-side comparisons by a factor ranging from 1.1 to 2.5. Relative comparisons across body regions do not offer advantages over absolute reference values. Application of this standardized QST protocol in patients and human surrogate models will allow to infer underlying mechanisms from somatosensory phenotypes. ?? 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {We have compiled a comprehensive QST protocol as part of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) using well established tests for nearly all aspects of somatosensation. This protocol encompasses thermal as well as mechanical testing procedures. Our rationale was to test for patterns of sensory loss (small and large nerve fiber functions) or gain (hyperalgesia, allodynia, hyperpathia), and to assess both cutaneous and deep pain sensitivity. The practicality of the QST protocol was tested in 18 healthy subjects, 21-58 years, half of them female. All subjects were tested bilaterally over face, hand and foot. We determined thermal detection and pain thresholds including a test for the presence of paradoxical heat sensations, mechanical detection thresholds to von Frey filaments and a 64-Hz tuning fork, mechanical pain thresholds to pinprick stimuli and blunt pressure, stimulus-response-functions for pinprick and dynamic mechanical allodynia (pain to light touch), and pain summation (wind-up ratio) using repetitive pinprick stimulation. The full protocol took 27 ?? 2.3 min per test area. The majority of QST parameters were normally distributed only after logarithmic transformation (secondary normalization) except for the frequency of paradoxical heat sensations, cold and heat pain thresholds, and for vibration detection thresholds. Thresholds were usually lowest over face, followed by hand, and then foot. Only thermal pain thresholds, wind-up ratio and vibration detection thresholds were not significantly dependent on the body region. There was no significant right-to-left difference for any of the QST parameters; left-to-right correlation coefficients ranged between 0.78 and 0.97, thus explaining between 61{\%} and 94{\%} of the variance. This study has shown that a complete somatosensory profile of one affected area and one unaffected control area, which will be necessary to characterize patients with a variety of diseases, can be obtained within 1 h. Case examples of selected patients illustrate the value of z-transformed QST data for an easy survey of individual symptom profiles. ?? 2005 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract = {The estimated prevalence of patients who report minor or no improvement of their symptoms and pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains high, ranging from 5{\%} to 40{\%}. The authors sought to determine whether chronic pain and functional health are related to specific variations in demographic data, surgical techniques, or radiographic pre- and postoperative findings. They also sought to identify independent risk factors for persistent moderate-to-severe chronic pain after TKA. A total of 272 patients who underwent primary TKA from October 2006 to August 2008 with a minimum follow-up of 1 year were identified from electronic medical records. A questionnaire to identify persistent postoperative pain (36-item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]) was mailed to these patients. Linear regression and logistic regression were used to identify predictors for SF-36 and chronic pain, respectively. Thirty-nine percent of patients reported persistent pain after TKA, with a median average pain score of 3 out of 10 and worst pain score of 5 out of 10. Independent risk factors for persistent pain are the length of the operative procedure (odds ratio [OR]=1.013), medical history of diabetes mellitus (OR=0.430), presence of preoperative flexion contracture (OR=1.089), and patellofemoral joint overstuffing (OR=0.915). Persistent postoperative pain is a common finding after TKA. Nonmodifiable risk factors could be used for risk stratification, whereas modifiable risk factors could be used as a clinical guidance for modification of some aspects of existing surgical techniques.},

abstract = {Pressure on skin. Pressure threshold. The abnormal loading of skin and other surface tissues unaccustomed to bearing large mechanical forces occurs under many circumstances of chronic disease or disability. A result of abnormal loading is breakdown of the body wall tissues. An effective rehabilitation program avoids the pathological processes that result in skin trauma and breakdown and encourages load-tolerance and adaptation, changes in the body wall so that the tissues do not enter an irreversible degenerative pathological process. In the past, prevention has been the principal approach to the challenge of maintaining healthy skin and avoiding breakdown; therefore, relatively little is described in the rehabilitation literature about skin adaptation. However, adaptation has been investigated in other fields, particularly biomechanics and comparative anatomy. The purpose of this paper is to assemble the research to date to present the current understanding of skin response to mechanical stress, specifically addressing load cases applicable to rehabilitation. Factors important to tissue response are considered and their effects on adaptation and breakdown are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This assessment evaluates the clinical utility, efficacy, and safety of quantitative sensory testing (QST). METHODS: By searching MEDLINE, Current Contents, and their personal files, the authors identified 350 articles. Selected articles utilized computer operated threshold systems, manually operated threshold systems, and electrical threshold devices. The authors evaluated the use of normal values and the degree of reproducibility between the same and different systems. Articles were rated using a standard classification of evidence scheme. RESULTS: Because of differences between systems, normal values from one system cannot be transposed to others. Reproducibility of results was also an important concern, and there is no consensus on how it should be defined. The authors identified no adequately powered class I studies demonstrating the effectiveness of QST in evaluating any particular disorder. A number of class II and III studies demonstrated that QST is probably or possibly useful in identifying small or large fiber sensory abnormalities in patients with diabetic neuropathy, small fiber neuropathies, uremic neuropathies, and demyelinating neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: QST is a potentially useful tool for measuring sensory impairment for clinical and research studies. However, QST results should not be the sole criteria used to diagnose pathology. Because malingering and other nonorganic factors can influence the test results, QST is not currently useful for the purpose of resolving medicolegal matters. Well-designed studies comparing different QST devices and methodologies are needed and should include patients with abnormalities detected solely by QST.},

abstract = {Background and purpose - The discrepancy between symptoms and radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is well described. However, little is known about whether radiographic severity is predictive of the clinical result of nonoperative treatment. We investigated whether radiographic severity and treatment type were associated with improvements in pain after nonoperative treatment of patients with knee OA. Patients and methods - A 5-year consecutive series of patients deemed not eligible for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by an experienced orthopedic surgeon was contacted 1-5 years later. Radiographic severity, age, sex, and BMI were registered at the consultation. At follow-up, patients were asked to answer a questionnaire on type of treatment and improvements in pain after treatment. Results - Of 1,848 patients who were not eligible for TKA, 1,414 (77{\%}) completed the follow-up questionnaire (mean age 66 (24-96) years; 55{\%} women). Radiographic severity was not associated with improvements in pain even after adjusting for treatment type, age, sex, and BMI (p {\textgreater} 0.1). The odds ratio of improvement was higher by a factor of 2 in patients who received physiotherapy or multimodal treatment than in patients who did not. Interpretation - Radiographic severity was not associated with improvements in pain after nonoperative treatment. Patients who are not eligible for TKA can confidently be referred to nonoperative treatment even if they have severe radiographic OA. The treatment should preferably be multimodal, including physiotherapy, as recommended in Danish and international clinical guidelines.},

Clinical pain intensity was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Bilateral PPTs were measured from the lower leg and forearm (spreading sensitization). Furthermore, the pain intensities evoked by 10 repeated pressure pain stimuli (temporal summation) at the knee and lower leg were assessed on an electronic VAS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean clinical pain intensity was not significantly different between groups. The PPTs from both lower leg and forearm were significantly lower in group 4 compared to groups 1, 2, and 3 and in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (p {\textless} 0.05). Temporal summations from the knee and lower leg were significantly facilitated in groups 3 and 4 compared to groups 1 and 2 (p {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Despite similar pain intensities, facilitated temporal summation is worse in re-TKA than in OA and patients with high local knee hyperalgesia show more prominent spreading sensitization.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 670,000 total knee replacements are performed annually in the United States; however, high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness of the procedure, as compared with nonsurgical interventions, is lacking., METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial, we enrolled 100 patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis who were eligible for unilateral total knee replacement. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo total knee replacement followed by 12 weeks of nonsurgical treatment (total-knee-replacement group) or to receive only the 12 weeks of nonsurgical treatment (nonsurgical-treatment group), which was delivered by physiotherapists and dietitians and consisted of exercise, education, dietary advice, use of insoles, and pain medication. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 12 months in the mean score on four Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales, covering pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, and quality of life (KOOS4); scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)., RESULTS: A total of 95 patients completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. In the nonsurgical-treatment group, 13 patients (26{\%}) underwent total knee replacement before the 12-month follow-up; in the total-knee-replacement group, 1 patient (2{\%}) received only nonsurgical treatment. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the total-knee-replacement group had greater improvement in the KOOS4 score than did the nonsurgical-treatment group (32.5 vs. 16.0; adjusted mean difference, 15.8 [95{\%} confidence interval, 10.0 to 21.5]). The total-knee-replacement group had a higher number of serious adverse events than did the nonsurgical-treatment group (24 vs. 6, P=0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with knee osteoarthritis who were eligible for unilateral total knee replacement, treatment with total knee replacement followed by nonsurgical treatment resulted in greater pain relief and functional improvement after 12 months than did nonsurgical treatment alone. However, total knee replacement was associated with a higher number of serious adverse events than was nonsurgical treatment, and most patients who were assigned to receive nonsurgical treatment alone did not undergo total knee replacement before the 12-month follow-up.

abstract = {Background: Peripheral and central sensitisation is prominent in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and could be important for the reduced efficacy in some cases after as well surgery as pharmacological interventions. Although sensitisation is important in KOA it is not known to what degree it contributes to the overall clinical pain problem. The aim was therefore to investigate how much a combination of quantitative pain measures assessing various pain mechanisms (local and spreading hyperalgesia, temporal and spatial summation, descending inhibition) could predict peak pain intensity in patients with KOA. Methods: While resting in a comfortable recumbent position the pressure pain thresholds (PPT) in the peripatellar region (eight locations) and at the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) were assessed by handheld pressure algometry, computer-controlled pressure algometry and cuff-algometry in the affected leg of 17 KOA patients without pain or sensory dysfunctions in other regions than the knee. Cuff-algometry was used to detect spatial pain summation of the lower leg. Temporal pain summation was assessed by repeated pressure stimulation on the TA muscle. The conditioning pain modulation (CPM) was evaluated by conditioning tonic arm pain and by PPT from the peripatellar region. The participants rated their peak pain intensity in the previous 24 h using on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Results: A multiple-regression model based on TA pressure pain sensitivity (spreading sensitisation) and temporal pain summation on the lower leg accounted for 55{\%} of the variance in peak pain intensity experienced by the patients (P= 0.001). Significant correlations (P{\textless} 0.05) were found between PPTs assessed by handheld pressure algometry in the peripatellar region and at TA (R= 0.94), PPTs assessed by computer-controlled pressure algometry and handheld pressure algometry in the peripatellar region (R= 0.71), PPTs assessed by computer-controlled pressure algometry in the peripatellar region and handheld pressure algometry at TA (R= 0.71) and temporal summation at the knee and at TA (R= 0.73). Conclusion: Based on the multiple regression model 55{\%} variance of the perceived maximal pain intensity in painful KOA could be explained by the quantitative experimental pain measures reflecting central pain mechanisms (spreading sensitisation, temporal summation). The lack of other correlations between the methods used in assessing pain mechanisms in this study highlights the importance of applying different tests and different pain modalities when assessing the sensitised pain system as different methods add complementary information.

abstract = {Background: Clinical decision-making in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a complex process needing further clarification. The aim of this study was to compare TKA eligibility criteria considered most important by orthopedic surgeons (OSs) to characteristics of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) eventually found eligible for TKA. Methods: Nine OSs chose the five criteria most important when deciding on TKA eligibility. Cross-sectional data from 200 patients found either eligible (n = 100) or not eligible (n = 100) for TKA by one of the nine OS, were analyzed in a regression analyses with TKA eligibility as the dependent variable. Results: Radiographic severity (n = 8), pain (n = 9), functional disability (n = 8) and not responding to the recommended non-surgical treatment (n = 7) were considered most important by OSs.Associations (P {\textless} 0.25) between TKA eligibility and criteria found important by the OS were demonstrated for worse radiographic severity and more functional limitations, but not for pain and not responding to the recommended non-surgical treatment.Furthermore, more comorbidities and higher Body Mass Index (BMI) were associated with TKA-eligibility, but not found important for TKA eligibility by the OS. Conclusion: Radiographic severity and functional limitations were confirmed as drivers for TKA eligibility, while pain was not. Not responding to non-surgical treatment was not included in the decision-making, suggesting low uptake of clinical guidelines in clinical practice. This study highlights the complexity of the decision-making with some overlap between the criteria that OSs think they apply and what is actually applied in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Pain and sensitization are major issues in patients with osteoarthritis both before and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and revision TKA (re-TKA). The aim of this study was to assess sensitization in patients with and without chronic pain after re-TKAs. Twenty patients with chronic knee pain and 20 patients without pain after re-TKA participated. Spreading of pain was evaluated as the number of pain sites using a region-divided body chart. The pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PTT) were assessed by cuff algometry at the lower leg. Temporal summation of pain was assessed by recordings of the pain intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS) during repeated cuff pressure stimulations. Conditioning pain modulation (CPM) was recorded by experimental tonic arm pain by cuff pressure stimulation and assessment of PPTs on the knee, leg, and forearm using handheld pressure algometry. Participants with pain after re-TKA compared to participants without pain demonstrated: (1) significantly more pain sites (P =.004), (2) decreased cuff PPTs and PTTs at the lower leg (P {\textless}.001), (3) facilitated temporal summation (P {\textless}.001), and (4) impaired CPM (P {\textless}.001). Additionally, significant correlations between knee pain intensity and cuff PPTs, temporal summation, and CPM and between total duration of knee pain and temporal summation were found (P {\textless}.05). This study demonstrated widespread sensitization in patients with pain after re-TKA and highlighted the importance of ongoing nociceptive input for the chronification process. This has important implications for future revisions, and precautions should be taken if patients have widespread sensitization. ?? 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract = {This article examines gender differences in health care provider?patient communication within the framework of an ecological model of communication in the medical encounter. The ecological perspective posits that, although health care provider?patient interactions are situated within a number of contexts (e.g. organizational, political, cultural), the interpersonal domain is the primary context within which these interactions unfold. Hence, gender may influence provider?patient interaction to the extent that it can be linked to the interactants? goals, skills, perceptions, emotions, and the way the participants adapt to their partner?s communication. The evidence reviewed in this essay indicates that gender differences in medical encounters may come from several sources including differences in men?s and women?s communicative styles, perceptions of their partners, and in the way they accommodate their partner?s behavior during the interaction. However, because gender is but one of many personal and partner variables (e.g. age, ethnicity, personal experiences) that can influence these processes, gender differences are often quite modest (if apparent at all) when examined across a population of health care providers and patients. Implications for future research and communicative skill training are discussed.},

abstract = {Objective: To systematically review the use of Quantitative sensory testing (QST) in pain characterisation (phenotyping) in Osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Six bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl, PubMed, Web of Science) were searched to identify studies published before May 2011. Data were extracted based on the primary site of OA, QST modalities, outcome measures and test sites. Standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated if possible. Publication bias was determined using funnel plot and Egger's test. Heterogeneity was examined using Cochran Q test and I2 statistic. Random effects model was used to pool the results. Results: Of 41 studies (2281 participants) included, 23 were case control studies, 15 case only studies, two randomised controlled trials, and one uncontrolled trial. The majority of studies examined pressure pain with smaller numbers using electrical and/or thermal stimuli. QST was more often applied to the affected joint than distal and remote sites. Of 20 studies comparing people with OA and healthy controls, seven provided sufficient information for meta-analysis. Compared with controls, people with OA had lower pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) both at the affected joint (SMD = -1.24, 95{\%}CI -1.54, -0.93) and at remote sites (SMD = -0.88, 95{\%}CI -1.11, -0.65). Conclusion: QST of PPTs demonstrated good ability to differentiate between people with OA and healthy controls. Lower PPTs in people with OA in affected sites may suggest peripheral, and in remote sites central, sensitisation. PPT measurement merits further evaluation as a tool for phenotyping OA pain. ?? 2012 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},

AIMS: To generate Danish population norms for the EQ-5D index score, stratified by age and gender. METHODS: The EQ-5D data from three population health surveys were pooled, thus providing EQ-5D profile data for 15,700 individuals aged 20-79 years. The Danish TTO scoring algorithm was used to weight each respondent's profile data to derive a single index score. Mean values were computed by gender and 10-year age groups, and educational groups. RESULTS: In a random sample from the general Danish population, the mean EQ-5D index score ranged between 0.93 for 20-29 year-olds and 0.83 for 70-79 year-olds. Men had a significantly higher score than women in all age groups. Longer education was associated with higher EQ-5D index score in most age groups.

abstract = {Electronic medical records (EMRs) hold the promise of improved patient safety, efficiency, and productivity, yet many physicians are reluctant to embrace their use. Barriers to adoption include perception of compromised productivity, ongoing expense, unreliability, and workflow limitations. Among all subspecialties, dermatology has one of the lowest rates of EMR use; therefore, published literature on the impact of EMR in dermatology is scarce. A fully functional EMR (Epic), complete with order-entry and clinical decision support capabilities, was implemented in October 2012. We conducted an anonymous survey of Duke Dermatology medical staff to assess the impact of EMR implementation on attitudes and perceptions. We used a pre/poststudy design and sent a 16-item survey before and 4 months after implementation. Sixty-three people were surveyed and response rates for baseline and postimplementation surveys were 65{\%} and 52{\%}, respectively. Respondents included clinical providers (attending physicians, physician assistants, and residents) and support staff (nurses, medical assistants, and front desk staff); attending physicians comprised 42{\%} of those surveyed. Among attending physicians surveyed, 79{\%} responded before and 64{\%} responded after implementation. Postimplementation, 58{\%} felt that documentation in the new EMR was burdensome, and 87{\%} felt that time spent documenting had increased. More than half of respondents (53{\%}) felt that patient volume had worsened. In terms of common functions, including finding clinic notes, prescribing medications, entering laboratory orders, and placing referral requests, the majority of respondents felt that these functions were worse compared to the previous system. These results are limited by their timing during the active learning phase of the new EMR but provide important insights in the perceptions and attitudes of “front line” users. Our staff perceived negative impacts of the new EMR on aspects of work efficiency and patient throughput. Future surveys should be implemented to assess the durability of these initial negative perceptions and capture changes in staff acceptance with the passage of time.},

What are the implications for the preclinical development and clinical use of analgesics for OA? How should existing treatment options be reassessed? Differences in the aetiology of OA and the pharmacological sensitivity of patients with OA pain with neuropathic features, compared with other patients with OA, might explain the frequent negative findings of clinical trials of treatments for symptomatic OA.

A questionnaire targeting knee surgeons' opinion on indications for primary TKA was distributed. Questions concerned opinions on aspects of pain, body mass index (BMI), exercise, function, age, clinical and radiographic findings, and specific patient cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 41 questionnaires were returned. Twenty-three knee surgeons performed {\textgreater} 100 TKAs annually. Opinions about the duration of knee pain and pain treatment, preoperative weight loss and exercise, excessive BMI as a contraindication, low age as a contraindication, and some of the specific patient cases demonstrated considerable variation. A statistically significantly higher proportion of high-volume versus low-volume knee surgeons did not find that BMI could be a contraindication to proceed with TKA surgery (p = 0.02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Opinions among knee surgeons about indications to perform TKA showed considerable variation.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a prevalent and costly problem. This review addresses the question of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the most common treatments for patients with chronic pain. DATA SOURCES: Representative published studies that evaluate the clinical effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, conservative (standard) care, surgery, spinal cord stimulators, implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs), and pain rehabilitation programs (PRPs) are examined and compared. The cost-effectiveness of these treatment approaches is also considered. DATA SYNTHESIS: Outcome criteria including pain reduction, medication use, health care consumption, functional activities, and closure of disability compensation cases are examined. In addition to clinical effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness of PRPs, conservative care, surgery, spinal cord stimulators, and IDDSs are compared using costs to return a treated patient to work to illustrate the relative expenses for each of these treatments. CONCLUSIONS: There are limitations to the success of all the available treatments. The author urges caution in interpreting the results, particularly in comparisons between treatments and across studies, because there are broad differences in the pain syndromes and inclusion criteria used, the drug dosages, comparability of treatments, the definition of "chronic" used, the outcome criteria selected to determine success, and societal differences. None of the currently available treatments eliminates pain for the majority of patients. Pain rehabilitation programs provide comparable reduction in pain to alternative pain treatment modalities, but with significantly better outcomes for medication use, health care utilization, functional activities, return to work, closure of disability claims, and with substantially fewer iatrogenic consequences and adverse events. Surgery, spinal cord stimulators, and IDDSs appear to have substantial benefits on some outcome criteria for carefully selected patients. These modalities are, however, expensive. Pain rehabilitation programs are significantly more cost effective than implantation of spinal cord stimulators, IDDSs, conservative care, and surgery, even for selected patients. Research is needed to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the available treatments and to study combinations of the available treatments since none of them appear capable of eliminating pain or significantly improving functional outcomes for all treated.},

abstract = {Pain biomarkers are warranted for individualized pain management. Based on different pain modulatory phenotypes the objectives of this study were to explore the existence of subgroups within nonmalignant chronic pain patients and to investigate differences in clinical pain and pain hypersensitivity between subgroups. Cuff algometry was performed on lower legs in 400 chronic pain patients to assess pressure pain threshold (cPPT), pressure pain tolerance (cPTT), temporal summation of pain (TSP: increase in pain scores to ten repeated stimulations), and conditioned pain modulation (CPM: increase in cPPT during cuff pain conditioning on the contralateral leg). Heat detection (HDT) and heat pain thresholds (HPT) at clinical painful and non-painful body areas were assessed. Based on TSP and CPM four distinct groups were formed: Group 1 (n=85) had impaired CPM and facilitated TSP. Group 2 (n=148) had impaired CPM and normal TSP. Group 3 (n=45) had normal CPM and facilitated TSP. Group 4 (n=122) had normal CPM and normal TSP. Group 1 showed more pain regions compared with the other three groups (P{\textless}0.001) indicating that impaired CPM and facilitated TSP plays an important role in widespread pain. Group 1 and 2 compared with group 4 had lower HPT at non-painful areas and lower cPTT (P{\textless}0.02) indicating that CPM plays a role for widespread hyperalgesia. Moreover, group 1 demonstrated higher clinical pain scores compared with group 4 (P{\textless}0.05). Although not different between subgroups, patients were profiled on demographics, disability, pain catastrophizing, and fear of movement. Future research should investigate interventions tailored towards these subgroups.},

abstract = {Background: Patient-related outcomes have become the focus of increased attention when assessing knee arthroplasty. Methods: We retrieved questionnaires from 485 (584 knees) patients at a minimum of 3. years after undergoing primary knee arthroplasty. We excluded bilateral knee arthroplasty, leaving 141 UKA and 245 TKA who rated their satisfaction and expectation regarding pain, range of motion (ROM), daily living function (DLF), return to recreational activity (RRA) and ability to kneel (ATK) on a scale of 0 (worst) to 10 (best). We further collected data on pain level and the modified Cincinnati rating scale. Range of motion was documented pre- and postoperatively at a minimum of six months. The cohort was subdivided into three age groups and compared with each other (Group 1: {\textless}. 55, n. = 113; Group 2: 55-64, n. = 117; Group 3: 65. +, n. = 155). Results: Average satisfaction with pain, ROM and ATK for patients under 55 was higher for UKA than for TKA. Patients {\textgreater}. 65 with TKA were on average more satisfied than patients with UKA in these three items. However, patients under 55 with UKA were up to 2.9 times more likely to have their expectations met when compared to patients receiving TKA. Patients with UKA under 55 rated their joint as good/excellent in 96.0{\%} versus patients in the same age group with TKA in 81.0{\%}. Conclusions: We found that overall, younger patients who were treated with UKA demonstrated higher satisfaction scores in most subsets when compared with the patients of the same age group who received TKA. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tibial osteotomy is a treatment for younger and/or physically active patients suffering from uni-compartmental knee osteoarthritis. The open wedge osteotomy by the hemicallotasis technique includes the use of external fixation. The use of external fixation has several advantages, as early mobilization and the opportunity for optimal correction. However, the hemicallotasis technique has also been described as a cumbersome procedure for the patient. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate patient-relevant outcomes during the first 2 post-operative years. Especially the treatment period, during which external fixation was used, was closely monitored.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In an uncontrolled study, fifty-eight consecutive patients, 30 men and 28 women (mean age 54 years) were operated on by the hemicallotasis technique were evaluated with the patient-relevant outcome measure Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) preoperatively, during the treatment with external fixation, one week after removal of the external fixation, at 6 months, and at one and two years postoperatively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At the 2-year postoperative follow-up, all subscales of the KOOS were improved (p {\textless} 0.001), mostly in pain (41-80 on a 0-100 worst to best scale) and knee-related quality of life (21-61 on a 0-100 worst to best scale), compared to the preoperative status. Significant improvements in pain and other symptoms, function of daily life and quality of life were seen already during the treatment period (mean 98 +/- 18 days) with the external fixation. More demanding functions such as kneeling, squatting, jumping and running, were improved first after extraction of the external fixation device and the pins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Tibial osteotomy by the hemicallotasis technique yields large improvement in self-rated pain, function and quality of life, which persists over two years. Surprisingly, large improvements occurred already during the immediate post-operative period when the external fixation was still used.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the agreement among orthopedic surgeons' indications for knee replacement, their perceptions of the usefulness of various treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee and their expected outcomes of knee replacement, and to determine the relation between these opinions and the number of knee replacement procedures performed by individual surgeons. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All 392 orthopedic surgeons in the province. Of the 325 practising traceable surgeons 234 (72.0{\%}) responded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Indications for knee replacement, perceived usefulness of treatments for osteoarthritis, perceived outcomes of knee replacement and number of knee replacement procedures performed by individual surgeons. RESULTS: The respondents disagreed on how 20 of 34 patient characteristics affected their decision to perform knee replacement surgery. They also disagreed on the usefulness of seven of eight treatments for arthritis of the knee. The respondents demonstrated variation in their expected outcomes of knee replacement. The surgeons who performed more procedures judged, on average, the outcomes to be better and to have fewer complications than the surgeons who performed fewer procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgeons demonstrated disagreement about some of the indications for knee replacement, the usefulness of treatments for arthritis of the knee and the perceived outcomes of knee replacement. The areas of greatest disagreement should be the focus of future research and the development of practice guidelines.},

abstract = {Objective: Chronic pain after total knee replacement (TKR) is a prevalent condition, affecting about 20{\%} of patients. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between pre-operative pain thresholds and chronic pain after TKR. Design: Patients listed for a TKR because of osteoarthritis participated in a Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) session prior to surgery. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) and hot pain thresholds were assessed at the osteoarthritic knee and the forearm. Patients were followed-up at 1-year after TKR, and the severity of pain in the replaced knee was assessed using the WOMAC Pain score. Pre-operative median QST thresholds were compared to thresholds from a normative database collected from 50 people with no knee pain. The relationship between pre-operative pain thresholds and pain severity post TKR were tested using correlations. Results: Fifty-one patients participated in a pre-operative QST session and completed a 1-year WOMAC Pain score. Pre-operatively, patients demonstrated evidence of localised (knee) and widespread (forearm) pain sensitisation in response to pressure stimuli compared to healthy participants. Pre-operative PPTs at the forearm were found to be significantly correlated with 1-year WOMAC Pain scores (r=0.37, P=0.008). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that pre-operative widespread pain sensitisation, measured using pressure algometry, may be associated with chronic pain after TKR. Further research is needed to explore the predictive value of an assessment of pre-operative widespread pain sensitisation in identifying who is likely to develop chronic pain after TKR. ?? 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},

abstract = {Chronic pain after joint replacement is common, affecting approximately 10{\%} of patients after total hip replacement (THR) and 20{\%} of patients after total knee replacement (TKR). Heightened generalized sensitivity to nociceptive input could be a risk factor for the development of this pain. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether preoperative widespread pain sensitivity was associated with chronic pain after joint replacement. Data were analyzed from 254 patients receiving THR and 239 patients receiving TKR. Pain was assessed preoperatively and at 12 months after surgery using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Pain Scale. Preoperative widespread pain sensitivity was assessed through measurement of pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) at the forearm using an algometer. Statistical analysis was conducted using linear regression and linear mixed models, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. In both the THR and TKR cohort, lower PPTs (heightened widespread pain sensitivity) were significantly associated with higher preoperative pain severity. Lower PPTs were also significantly associated with higher pain severity at 12 months after surgery in the THR cohort. However, PPTs were not associated with the change in pain severity from preoperative to 12 months postoperative in either the TKR or THR cohort. These findings suggest that although preoperative widespread pressure pain sensitivity is associated with pain severity before and after joint replacement, it is not a predictor of the amount of pain relief that patients gain from joint replacement surgery, independent of preoperative pain severity.},

abstract = {This study aims to individualize the selection of drugs for neuropathic pain by examining the potential coupling of a given drug's mechanism of action with the patient's pain modulation pattern. The latter is assessed by the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and temporal summation (TS) protocols. We hypothesized that patients with a malfunctioning pain modulation pattern, such as less efficient CPM, would benefit more from drugs augmenting descending inhibitory pain control than would patients with a normal modulation pattern of efficient CPM. Thirty patients with painful diabetic neuropathy received 1 week of placebo, 1 week of 30 mg/d duloxetine, and 4 weeks of 60 mg/d duloxetine. Pain modulation was assessed psychophysically, both before and at the end of treatment. Patient assessment of drug efficacy, assessed weekly, was the study's primary outcome. Baseline CPM was found to be correlated with duloxetine efficacy (r = 0.628, P {\textless}.001, efficient CPM is marked negative), such that less efficient CPM predicted efficacious use of duloxetine. Regression analysis (R2 = 0.673; P =.012) showed that drug efficacy was predicted only by CPM (P =.001) and not by pretreatment pain levels, neuropathy severity, depression level, or patient assessment of improvement by placebo. Furthermore, beyond its predictive value, the treatment-induced improvement in CPM was correlated with drug efficacy (r = -0.411, P =.033). However, this improvement occurred only in patients with less efficient CPM (16.8 ± 16.0 to -1.1 ± 15.5, P {\textless}.050). No predictive role was found for TS. In conclusion, the coupling of CPM and duloxetine efficacy highlights the importance of pain pathophysiology in the clinical decision-making process.

abstract = {Purpose: To develop concise, patient-focussed, up to date, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), which are adaptable and designed to assist physicians and allied health care professionals in general and specialist practise throughout the world. Methods: Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines (primary care, rheumatology, orthopaedics and evidence-based medicine), two continents and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. A systematic review of existing guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA published between 1945 and January 2006 was undertaken using the validated appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument. A core set of management modalities was generated based on the agreement between guidelines. Evidence before 2002 was based on a systematic review conducted by European League Against Rheumatism and evidence after 2002 was updated using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library and HTA reports. The quality of evidence was evaluated, and where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk or odds ratio and cost per quality-adjusted life years gained were estimated. Consensus recommendations were produced following a Delphi exercise and the strength of recommendation (SOR) for propositions relating to each modality was determined using a visual analogue scale. Results: Twenty-three treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA were identified from the literature search, including six opinion-based, five evidence-based and 12 based on both expert opinion and research evidence. Twenty out of 51 treatment modalities addressed by these guidelines were universally recommended. ES for pain relief varied from treatment to treatment. Overall there was no statistically significant difference between non-pharmacological therapies [0.25, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.16, 0.34] and pharmacological therapies (ES = 0.39, 95{\%} CI 0.31, 0.47). Following feedback from Osteoarthritis Research International members on the draft guidelines and six Delphi rounds consensus was reached on 25 carefully worded recommendations. Optimal management of patients with OA hip or knee requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities of therapy. Recommendations cover the use of 12 non-pharmacological modalities: education and self-management, regular telephone contact, referral to a physical therapist, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. Eight recommendations cover pharmacological modalities of treatment including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) non-selective and selective oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronates, glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulphate for symptom relief; glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and diacerein for possible structure-modifying effects and the use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of refractory pain. There are recommendations covering five surgical modalities: total joint replacements, unicompartmental knee replacement, osteotomy and joint preserving surgical procedures; joint lavage and arthroscopic debridement in knee OA, and joint fusion as a salvage procedure when joint replacement had failed. Strengths of recommendation and 95{\%} CIs are provided. Conclusion: Twenty-five carefully worded recommendations have been generated based on a critical appraisal of existing guidelines, a systematic review of research evidence and the consensus opinions of an international, multidisciplinary group of experts. The recommendations may be adapted for use in different countries or regions according to the availability of treatment modalities and SOR for each modality of therapy. These recommendations will be revised regularly following systematic review of new research evidence as this becomes available. ?? 2008 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},
