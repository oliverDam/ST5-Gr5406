abstract = {The Osteoarthritis (OA) Criteria Subcommittee of the American Rheumatism Association set out to develop (a) a classification of OA that includes recognised subsets; and (b) subsets of OA identified by a combination of clinical and laboratory features. For the purposes of classification, OA should be specified if of unknown origin (idiopathic, primary) or if related to a known medical condition or event (secondary). Clinical criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the knee were developed through a multicentre study group involving 130 patients with OA and 107 comparison patients. Comparison diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other painful conditions of the knee exclusive of referred or para-articular pain. Variables from the history, physical examination, laboratory test results and radiographs were used to develop sets of criteria that serve different investigative purposes: clinical examination (sensitivity 89{\%}; specificity 88{\%}); clinical examination and laboratory tests (sensitivity 88{\%}; specificity 93{\%}); clinical examination, laboratory tests and radiographs (sensitivity 94{\%}; specificity 88{\%}). In contrast to prior classification criteria, the proposed criteria utilise decision trees or algorithms. Clinical criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the hip are under development. Comparison groups are comprised of patients with other rheumatic diseases (e.g. RA), periarticular pain (e.g. trochanteric bursitis) and referred pain (e.g low back pain). From a method of opinion sampling, OA of the hip may be suggested by a combination of clinical criteria including the following: age greater than 40 years, weight-bearing pain, pain relieved by sitting, antalgic gait, decreased painful range of motion, a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and a negative rheumatoid factor test.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In a cohort of well-characterized patients with different degrees of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and pain, the aims were to utilize mechanism-based quantitative sensory testing (QST) to (1) characterize subgroups of patients; (2) analyse the associations between clinical characteristics and QST; and (3) develop and apply a QST-based knee OA composite pain sensitivity index for patient classification. METHODS Two hundred seventeen OA pain patients and 64 controls were included. Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grading scores were obtained, and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), temporal summation of pain to repeated painful pressure stimulation and conditioning pain modulation (CPM) were assessed. Associations between pain score/area/duration, radiological findings and QST-related parameters were analysed. A pain sensitivity index was developed and applied based on PPT, temporal summation and CPM. z-Score, as statistical tool, was calculated for statistically comparing the pain index of a single patient with a healthy control group. RESULTS High knee pain associated with low KL grade showed particular signs of pain sensitization. Patients showed significant associations between clinical knee pain intensity/duration and lowering of knee PPTs (p {\textless} 0.01), facilitation of temporal summation (p {\textless} 0.01), reduction of CPM function (p {\textless} 0.01) and high pain sensitivity index (p {\textless} 0.01). The index classified 27-38{\%} of the OA patients and 3{\%} of the controls as highly sensitive with no association to KL. The index increased for high knee pain intensities and long pain duration. CONCLUSIONS Radiological scores, contrary to clinical pain intensity/duration, were poorly associated with QST parameters. The pain sensitivity index could classify OA patients with different degrees of OA and pain.},

abstract = {Pain is the dominant symptom in osteoarthritis (OA) and sensitization may contribute to the pain severity. This study investigated the role of sensitization in patients with painful knee OA by measuring (1) pressure pain thresholds (PPTs); (2) spreading sensitization; (3) temporal summation to repeated pressure pain stimulation; (4) pain responses after intramuscular hypertonic saline; and (5) pressure pain modulation by heterotopic descending noxious inhibitory control (DNIC). Forty-eight patients with different degrees of knee OA and twenty-four age- and sex-matched control subjects participated. The patients were separated into strong/severe (VAS ??? 6) and mild/moderate pain (VAS {\textless} 6) groups. PPTs were measured from the peripatellar region, tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles before, during and after DNIC. Temporal summation to pressure was measured at the most painful site in the peripatellar region and over TA. Patients with severely painful OA pain have significantly lower PPT than controls. For all locations (knee, leg, and arm) significantly negative correlations between VAS and PPT were found (more pain, more sensitization). OA patients showed a significant facilitation of temporal summation from both the knee and TA and had significantly less DNIC as compared with controls. No correlations were found between standard radiological findings and clinical/experimental pain parameters. However, patients with lesions in the lateral tibiofemoral knee compartment had higher pain ratings compared with those with intercondylar and medial lesions. This study highlights the importance of central sensitization as an important manifestation in knee OA. ?? 2010.},

When surveyed, physicians report that the patient's sex has no effect on their decision-making; however, what occurs in clinical practice may be different. The purpose of our study was to determine whether patients' sex affects physicians' decisions to refer a patient for, or to perform, total knee arthroplasty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seventy-one physicians (38 family physicians and 33 orthopedic surgeons) in Ontario performed blinded assessments of 2 standardized patients (1 man and 1 woman) with moderate knee osteoarthritis who differed only by sex. The standardized patients recorded the physicians' final recommendations about total knee arthroplasty. Four surgeons did not consent to the inclusion of their data. After detecting an overall main effect, we tested for an interaction with physician type (family physician v. orthopedic surgeon). We used a binary logistic regression analysis with a generalized estimating equation approach to assess the effect of patients' sex on physicians' recommendations for total knee arthroplasty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 42{\%} of physicians recommended total knee arthroplasty to the male but not the female standardized patient, and 8{\%} of physicians recommended total knee arthroplasty to the female but not the male standardized patient (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 2.4-7.3, p {\textless} 0.001; risk ratio [RR] 2.1, 95{\%} CI 1.5-2.8, p {\textless} 0.001).

We performed a cross-sectional study of patient satisfaction after 1703 primary TKAs performed in the province of Ontario. Our data confirmed that approximately one in five (19{\%}) primary TKA patients were not satisfied with the outcome. Satisfaction with pain relief varied from 72-86{\%} and with function from 70-84{\%} for specific activities of daily living. The strongest predictors of patient dissatisfaction after primary TKA were expectations not met (10.7x greater risk), a low 1-year WOMAC (2.5x greater risk), preoperative pain at rest (2.4x greater risk) and a postoperative complication requiring hospital readmission (1.9x greater risk).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

abstract = {BackgroundPrior investigations have suggested that physician-related factors may contribute to differential use of TKA among women and ethnic minorities. We sought to evaluate the effect of surgeon bias on recommendations for TKA. Questions/purposeUsing an experimental approach with standardized patient scenarios, we sought to evaluate surgeon recommendations regarding TKA, specifically to determine whether recommendations for TKA are influenced by (1) patient race, and (2) patient sex. MethodsWe developed four computerized scenarios for all combinations of race (white or black) and sex (male or female) for otherwise similar patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Patients gave an orthopaedic history of 2 years worsening pain with decreased functional status and failure of oral antiinflammatory medications and corticosteroid intraarticular injections. Orthopaedic surgeons attending the 2012 annual meetings of the New York State Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons were recruited for the study. Surgeons passing an open recruitment table at each meeting were asked to participate. Of the 1111 surgeons in attendance at either meeting, 113 (10.2{\%}) participated in the study. All participants viewed the “control” patient's story (white male) and were randomized to view one of the three “experimental” scenarios (white female, black male, black female). After viewing each scenario, the participants were anonymously asked whether they would recommend TKA. An a priori power analysis showed that 112 participants were needed to detect a 15{\%} difference in the likelihood of recommending surgery for white versus nonwhite patients in the test scenarios evaluated with 90{\%} power at a level of significance of 0.05. ResultsOf the 39 surgeons who viewed the white male plus black female scenario, there were 33 (85{\%}) concordant responses (TKA offered to both patients) and six discordant responses (TKA offered to only one of the patients), with no effect of patient race and sex (p = 0.99). Of the 37 surgeons who viewed the white male plus black male scenario, there were 33 (89{\%}) concordant responses and four discordant responses, with no effect of patient race (p = 0.32). Of the 37 surgeons who viewed the white male plus white female scenario, there were 30 (77{\%}) concordant responses and seven discordant responses, with no effect of patient sex (p = 0.71). ConclusionAfter orthopaedic surgeons viewed video scenarios of patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis, patient race and sex were not associated with a different likelihood of a surgical recommendation. Our findings support the notion that patient race and sex may be less influential on decision making when there are strong clinical data to support a decision. Physician bias may have a greater effect on decision making in situations where the indications for surgery are less clear.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) who have worse physical function preoperatively achieve a postoperative status that is similar to that of patients with better preoperative function. METHODS: This study surveyed an observational cohort of 379 consecutive patients with definite OA who were without other inflammatory joint diseases and were undergoing either total hip or knee replacement in a US (Boston) and a Canadian (Montreal) referral center. Questionnaires on health status (the Short Form 36 and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) were administered preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Physical function and pain due to OA were deemed the most significant outcomes to study. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two patients returned their questionnaires. Patients in the 2 centers were comparable in age, sex, time to surgery, and proportion of hip/knee surgery. The Boston group had more education, lower comorbidity, and more cemented knee prostheses. Patients undergoing hip or knee replacement in Montreal had lower preoperative physical function and more pain than their Boston counterparts. In patients with lower preoperative physical function, function and pain were not improved postoperatively to the level achieved by those with higher preoperative function. This was most striking in patients undergoing total knee replacement. CONCLUSION: Surgery performed later in the natural history of functional decline due to OA of the knee, and possibly of the hip, results in worse postoperative functional status.},

abstract = {Objectives: To describe practice patterns in the management of osteoporosis after fragility fracture. Methods: Systematic review of articles in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases (1996 to February 2005). Diagnostic outcomes included clinical osteoporosis diagnoses, laboratory tests, and bone density scans. Treatment outcomes included initiation of calcium, vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, raloxifene and falls assessments. Results: Thirty-five studies met our inclusion criteria and demonstrated that adults who experience fragility fracture are not receiving osteoporosis management. An osteoporosis diagnosis was reported in 1 to 45{\%} of patients with fractures; laboratory tests were ordered for 1 to 49{\%} and 1 to 32{\%} of patients had bone density scans. Calcium/vitamin D and pharmacological therapy was reported in 2 to 62{\%} and 1 to 65{\%} of patients, respectively. Osteoporosis treatment was recommended more often in women than men, and more often in patients with vertebral fractures than in patients with nonvertebral fractures. Older patients were more likely to be diagnosed with osteoporosis, but treatment was more likely in younger patients. A history of prior fracture was reported in 7 to 67{\%} of patients. Between 1 and 22{\%} of patients had a subsequent fracture during follow-up periods of 6 months to 5 years. Falls assessments were not often reported; when they were, they were infrequently performed. A greater proportion of patients were diagnosed/treated during follow-up studies than in studies evaluating diagnosis/treatment on discharge from acute care. Conclusions: The majority of individuals who sustain fragility fractures are not receiving adequate osteoporosis management. Future research should address barriers to appropriate management and the efficacy of implementation strategies designed to close the osteoporosis care gap. Relevance: This article is of particular importance to health care professionals who provide care for patients with fragility fracture. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQL) has become increasingly common in health services research. Whilst useful, its focus on behaviour, capacities and activities means that it remains relatively specific. This paper explores the possibility of extending the evaluation of health by considering the concept of patients' expectations. DESIGN: In-depth and semi-structured interviews were used to explore the concept of expectations from the patients' perspective. Patients' expectations were then used in the construction of a two-part questionnaire. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Expectations were explored with a group of 33 cardiac patients. The resulting questionnaire was given to 400 cardiac patients in a large teaching hospital in London. RESULTS: Patients identified a range of expectations which related to their health and seemed to represent the desired results of their hospital stay. Comparison of the content of patient expectations with a commonly used generic measure of HRQL, the Short-Form 36 (SF-36), found some overlap but indicated that patients seemed to adopt a broader approach to their health. Expectations that patients identified were used to construct two scales to measure expectations and their evaluation. The internal consistency of these scales was 0.82 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study indicates the potential complexity of the concept of expectations and the need for further exploration. It also demonstrates the feasibility of constructing standardized scales to measure patient expectations. Whilst conceptually different from HRQL such standardized expectations scales could provide a useful adjunct to HRQL measurement and provide a meaningful context for the interpretation of HRQL data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although it is recognized that medical and surgical procedures may lead to persistent postoperative pain, predicting which patients are at risk for developing chronic pain presents an ongoing challenge. Clinical observations indicate that similar invasive procedures associated with consequent peripheral tissue damage can cause a wide range of pain experience. This broad variability is likely a consequence of the diversity in the central pain processing of the peripherally generated noxious stimulation. Therefore, advanced psychophysical measures that dynamically represent central pain modulation mechanisms may be used to determine an individual's susceptibility to developing persistent postoperative pain. This review highlights how, and to what extent, preoperative experimental pain testing can be utilized in predicting persistent postoperative pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Conflicting findings emerged regarding the role of traditional experimental pain tests, including pain threshold, supra-threshold magnitude estimation, and tolerance in the prediction of acute postoperative pain. Less efficient endogenous modulation and greater sensitization, as preoperatively assessed by advanced experimental pain tests, were associated with higher persistent postoperative pain scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: The preoperative identification of individuals who have enhanced pain sensitivity and are at risk for developing persistent postoperative pain is important to providing them with better treatment that is specifically tailored to their altered pain modulation, as represented psychophysically.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The modest association between radiographic joint damage and pain in osteoarthritis (OA) has led to the suggestion of facilitated central pain processing. This study evaluated the importance of ongoing tissue pathology in the maintenance of enhanced central pain processing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Pain assessment was performed on 48 patients with symptomatic knee OA and 21 sex- and age-matched pain-free healthy control subjects. Twenty of the OA patients subsequently underwent total knee replacement surgery and were reassessed. Pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs) were recorded using a pressure algometer (both over and distant from the knee) and a double-chamber inflatable cuff mounted around the calf. Spatial summation was assessed by relating PPTs using the dual- and single-chamber cuff. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was assessed by recording the increase in PPT in response to experimental arm pain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PPTs at the knee and at sites away from the knee were reduced in OA patients as compared with healthy pain-free control subjects (P {\textless} 0.0001). Cuff PPTs were decreased in OA patients as compared with the healthy controls (P {\textless} 0.05), who also exhibited a greater degree of spatial summation (P {\textless} 0.05). Whereas an elevation of PPTs was noted in the healthy controls in response to experimental arm pain (P {\textless} 0.0001), no such CPM was observed in the OA patients. Following joint replacement in the OA patients, there was a reduction in the widespread mechanical hyperesthesia, along with normalization of spatial summation ratios and restoration of CPM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The widespread hyperesthesia and enhanced spatial summation observed in OA patients imply sensitized central pain mechanisms together with the loss of CPM. Normalization of the results following joint replacement implies that these central pain processes are maintained by peripheral input.},

abstract = {A 5-year experience with 562 carotid endarterectomies, using electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and selective shunting, was reviewed. EEG changes occurred in 102 patients (18{\%}). The frequency of EEG changes, as related to cerebral vascular symptoms, was as follows: transient ischemic attacks, seven per cent (19/259); completed strokes, 37{\%} (36/98); vertebral basilar insufficiency, 24{\%} (32/135); asymptomatic, 21{\%} (15/71). Patients with contralateral carotid occlusion exhibited EEG changes in 37{\%} (28/76) of operations. Fifteen patients suffered perioperative strokes (2.6{\%}). Nine of the 15 were associated with a technical problem of either thrombosis of the internal carotid artery (five) or emboli (four). Technical problems were more common when shunts were used (five per cent) than when they were not (0.9{\%}). Patients who suffered strokes prior to surgery were more at risk to develop a perioperative stroke (three per cent) than those not suffering prior strokes (0.3{\%}). The EEG did not change in three patients who had lacunar infarcts prior to surgery and who awoke with a worsened deficit. Our series does not clearly establish the advantages of EEG monitoring, which is expensive (+375/patient) and may not detect ischemia in all areas of the brain. However, the use of shunts may introduce a risk of stroke due to technical error that is equal or greater than the risk of stroke due to hemodynamic ischemia. Since the need for protection is unpredictable by angiographic or clinical criteria, the benefit of EEG monitoring may be in reducing the incidence of shunting in those patients whose tracing remains normal after clamping. The decision to shunt, however, when there is electrical dysfunction after carotid clamping should be based not only on the EEG but also on the clinical signs and computed tomography (CT) scan. Our data does not show a net benefit in selective shunting unless the patient has sustained a stroke prior to surgery.},

abstract = {The International Association for the Study of Pain (ISAP) describes pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage". Pain is the sensation that usually arises when noxious stimulus causes real or potential damage to bodily tissue. The neural encoding and further processing elicited by such stimuli is called nociception. Pain can be essentially divided into two categories: adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protecting organism from injury. Contrary, maladaptive pain is an expression of the pathologic operation of nervous system. Chronic pain in humans has been arbitrarily defined as pain lasting for more than 6 months. It is not only results from prolonged sensitization of nociceptive neurons but also from influence of social and psychological factors.},

However, no consensus has been reached regarding brain activity associated with pain-induced conditions in OA patients. We examined cerebral responses using intra-epidermal electrical stimulation of the knee in knee OA patients. To replicate the pain of knee OA in terms of predictability, acute pain generated by electrical stimulation was provided simultaneously with displayed images in this study. We used fMRI to identify differences in response between healthy subjects and knee OA patients and explored the modulating cortico-subcortical and cortico-cortical pathways using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Our results show that chronic pain results in a different brain activation profile in the DLPFC and the pain matrix in knee OA patients. Abnormal brain connectivity between the DLPFC and the pain matrix is induced by chronic pain in knee OA patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: One hundred and eight patients with varus gonarthrosis were treated with high tibial osteotomy (HTO) in 2001. Fifty one patients received an open wedge osteotomy by using the 'Puddu' plate and 57 patients received a Coventry-type closing wedge osteotomy. For both groups the follow-up examination period was 22.5 months (253-1009 days). MATERIAL AND METHODS: To evaluate the study, radiological and subjective criteria as well as the Lysholm and the Tegner Activity Score were used. Altogether 84 {\%} of the patients were included in the follow-up examination study. RESULTS: In both groups a significant improvement of both scores were achieved. Both methods obtained safe and reproducible results for the correction considering the different operation techniques. There were no differences in outcome between the two methods. Satisfactory results were also achieved for early arthrosis of the femoropatellar and the lateral compartment. CONCLUSION: Open and closed wedge HTOs obtain significant improvement in patients with medial osteoarthritis of the knee. Using the right technique is very important for good results. For stabilization of the medial ligament we recommend the open wedge osteotomy. The patient should be informed about the routine removal of the metal plate.},

Risk factors can be divided into person-level factors, such as age, sex, obesity, genetics, race/ethnicity and diet, and joint-level factors including injury, malalignment and abnormal loading of the joints. The interaction of these risk factors is complex and provides a challenge to the managing physician. The purpose of this review is to illustrate how each of these factors interact together to instigate incident OA as well as to outline the need for ongoing epidemiologic studies for the future prevention of both incident and progressive OA.

abstract = {Objectives: To identify the optimal exercise program characterized by type and intensity of exercise, length of exercise program, duration of individual supervised sessions, and number of sessions per week for reducing pain and patient-reported disability in knee osteoarthritis. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were combined using a random effects model. Study-level covariates were applied in meta-regression analyses in order to reduce the between study heterogeneity. Results: Forty-eight trials were included. Similar effects in reducing pain were found for aerobic, resistance and performance exercise (SMD: 0.67, 0.62 and 0.48; P=0.733). These single type exercise programs were more efficacious than mixing different exercise types (SMD: 0.61 vs. 0.16; P{\textless}0.001). The effect of aerobic exercise on pain relief increased with a larger number of supervised sessions (slope: 0.022 [95{\%}CI: 0.002; 0.043]. More pain reduction occurred with quadriceps-specific exercise compared with lower-limb exercise (SMD: 0.85 vs. 0.39; P=0.005); and when supervised exercise was performed at least three times a week (SMD: 0.68 vs. 0.41; P=0.017). No impact of intensity, duration of individual sessions or patient characteristics was found. Similar results were found analyzing the effect on patient-reported disability. Conclusion: Optimal exercise programs for knee OA should have one aim and focus on improving aerobic capacity, quadriceps muscle strength or lower extremity performance. For best effect, the program should be supervised and carried out three times a week. Such programs have similar effect regardless of patient characteristics, including radiographic severity and baseline pain. {\textcopyright} 2013 American College of Rheumatology.},

abstract = {Background and purpose - Pain sensitization may be one of the reasons for persistent pain after technically successful joint replacement. We analyzed how pain sensitization, as measured by quantitative sensory testing, relates preoperatively to joint function in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) scheduled for joint replacement. Patients and methods - We included 50 patients with knee OA and 49 with hip OA who were scheduled for joint replacement, and 15 control participants. Hip/knee scores, thermal and pressure detection, and pain thresholds were examined. Results - Median pressure pain thresholds were lower in patients than in control subjects: 4.0 (range: 0-10) vs. 7.8 (4-10) (p = 0.003) for the affected knee; 4.5 (2-10) vs. 6.8 (4-10) (p = 0.03) for the affected hip. Lower pressure pain threshold values were found at the affected joint in 26 of the 50 patients with knee OA and in 17 of the 49 patients with hip OA. The American Knee Society score 1 and 2, the Oxford knee score, and functional questionnaire of Hannover for osteoarthritis score correlated with the pressure pain thresholds in patients with knee OA. Also, Harris hip score and the functional questionnaire of Hannover for osteoarthritis score correlated with the cold detection threshold in patients with hip OA. Interpretation - Quantitative sensory testing appeared to identify patients with sensory changes indicative of mechanisms of central sensitization. These patients may require additional pain treatment in order to profit fully from surgery. There were correlations between the clinical scores and the level of sensitization.},

The aim of the study was to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of predictor variables associated with persistent pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Included studies were required to measure predictor variables prior to or at the time of surgery, include a pain outcome measure at least 3 months post-TKA, and include a statistical analysis of the effect of the predictor variable(s) on the outcome measure. Counts were undertaken of the number of times each predictor was analysed and the number of times it was found to have a significant relationship with persistent pain. Separate meta-analyses were performed to determine the effect size of each predictor on persistent pain. Outcomes from studies implementing uni- and multivariable statistical models were analysed separately.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Thirty-two studies involving almost 30 000 patients were included in the review. Preoperative pain was the predictor that most commonly demonstrated a significant relationship with persistent pain across uni- and multivariable analyses. In the meta-analyses of data from univariate models, the largest effect sizes were found for: other pain sites, catastrophizing, and depression. For data from multivariate models, significant effects were evident for: catastrophizing, preoperative pain, mental health, and comorbidities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Catastrophizing, mental health, preoperative knee pain, and pain at other sites are the strongest independent predictors of persistent pain after TKA.},

abstract = {It has been estimated that up to 54{\%} of the variance in postoperative pain experience may be predicted with preoperative pain responses to experimental stimuli, with suprathreshold heat pain as the most consistent test modality. This study aimed to explore whether 2 heat test paradigms could predict postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients scheduled for elective, unilateral, primary TKA under spinal anesthesia were consecutively included in this prospective, observational study. Perioperative analgesia was standardized for all patients. Outcomes were postoperative pain during walk: from 6 to 24hours (primary), from postoperative day (POD) 1 to 7 (secondary), and from POD 14 to 30 (tertiary). Two preoperative tonic heat stimuli with 47°C were used; short (5seconds) and long (7minutes) stimulation upon which patients rated their pain response on an electronic visual analog scale. Multivariate stepwise linear and logistic regressions analyses were carried out, including 8 potential preoperative explanatory variables (among these anxiety, depression, preoperative pain, and pain catastrophizing) to assess pain response to preoperative heat pain stimulation as an independent predictor for postoperative pain. A total of 100 patients were included, and 3 were later excluded. A weak correlation [rho (95{\%} confidence interval); P value] was observed between pain from POD 1 to 7 and pain response to short [rho=0.25(0.04 to 0.44); P=.02] and to long [rho=0.27 (0.07 to 0.46); P=.01] heat pain stimulation. However, these positive correlations were not supported by the linear and logistic regression analyses, in which only anxiety, preoperative pain, and pain catastrophizing were significant explanatory variables (but with low R-squares; 0.05 to 0.08). Pain responses to 2 types of preoperative heat stimuli were not independent clinically relevant predictors for postoperative pain after TKA.},

The clinical evaluation included preoperative pain and inflammation of the operative knee, postoperative assessment of pain at rest and during movement (Visual Analog Scale score), cumulative morphine consumption, and circumference and temperature of both knees. QST included thermal and mechanical (pressure) pain threshold measurements and assessment of responses to suprathreshold stimuli. Brush-evoked allodynia was also evaluated. Measurements were taken on the operative knee, contralateral knee, and on the hand as a control site.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All patients had prolonged and severe pain before surgery and inflammation of the operative knee. Preoperative QST provided evidence of heat hyperalgesia in the inflammatory area on the operative knee, but absence of punctate or brush-evoked allodynia in the adjacent noninflamed area. Patients had intense postoperative pain, mostly induced by movement. Primary heat hyperalgesia was present on the operative knee on the first and fourth day after surgery, and was associated with punctate mechanical allodynia in the inflammatory area, but not in the adjacent noninflamed area. Postoperative morphine consumption was correlated with preoperative heat hyperalgesia (r = 0.63; P = 0.01). QST returned to baseline at the 4-mo evaluation. Only four patients had moderate knee pain induced by movement at that time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Heat hyperalgesia was the predominant QST symptom associated with perioperative pain after total knee arthroplasty, and was predictive of postoperative morphine consumption.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Multiple mechanisms are involved in pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA). The painDETECT and Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) questionnaires screen for neuropathic pain and may also identify individuals with musculoskeletal pain who exhibit abnormal central pain processing. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate painDETECT and S-LANSS for classification agreement and fit to the Rasch model, and to explore their relationship to pain severity and pain mechanisms in OA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 192 patients with knee OA completed questionnaires covering different aspects of pain. Another group of 77 patients with knee OA completed questionnaires and underwent quantitative sensory testing for pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs). Agreement between painDETECT and S-LANSS was evaluated using kappa coefficients and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Rasch analysis of both questionnaires was conducted. Relationships between screening questionnaires and measures of pain severity or PPTs were calculated using correlations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PainDETECT and S-LANSS shared a stronger correlation with each other than with measures of pain severity. ROC curves identified optimal cutoff scores for painDETECT and S-LANSS to maximize agreement, but the kappa coefficient was low ($\kappa$ = 0.33-0.46). Rasch analysis supported the measurement properties of painDETECT but not those of S-LANSS. Higher painDETECT scores were associated with widespread reductions in PPTs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The data suggest that painDETECT assesses pain quality associated with augmented central pain processing in patients with OA. Although developed as a screening questionnaire, painDETECT may also function as a measure of characteristics that indicate augmented central pain processing. Agreement between painDETECT and S-LANSS for pain classification was low, and it is currently unknown which tool may best predict treatment outcome.},

This study aimed to investigate the difference in pain, mobility, and quality of life (QoL) in patients after revision TKA compared with patients after primary TKA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 99 OA patients after revision TKA surgery and 215 patients after primary TKA surgery were investigated in a cross-sectional study using: a pain description of current pain (non-existent, mild, moderate, severe, or unbearable), the pain intensity visual analogue scale, the Knee Society Score, and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International questionnaire.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen percent after primary TKA surgery and 47{\%} after revision TKA surgery experienced severe to unbearable chronic postoperative pain. After revision TKA surgery patients reported higher pain intensities during rest (P=0.039), while walking (P=0.008), and on average over the last 24 hours (P=0.050) compared with the patients after primary TKA surgery. Patients after revision TKA surgery had reduced walking distance (P=0.001), increased use of walking aids (P=0.015), and showed an overall decreased QoL (P{\textless}0.001) compared with patients after primary TKA surgery. No significant improvement was found in walking distance (P=0.448) for patients before revision TKA surgery compared with after revision TKA surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: More than twice as many patients have pain after revision surgery compared with patients after primary TKA. Patients after revision TKA surgery have reduced function, poorer QoL, and higher pain intensity compared with patients after primary TKA surgery.},

abstract = {The nationwide multicenter trials of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) aim to characterize the somatosensory phenotype of patients with neuropathic pain. For this purpose, we have implemented a standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol giving a complete profile for one region within 30 min. To judge plus or minus signs in patients we have now established age- and gender-matched absolute and relative QST reference values from 180 healthy subjects, assessed bilaterally over face, hand and foot. We determined thermal detection and pain thresholds including a test for paradoxical heat sensations, mechanical detection thresholds to von Frey filaments and a 64 Hz tuning fork, mechanical pain thresholds to pinprick stimuli and blunt pressure, stimulus/response-functions for pinprick and dynamic mechanical allodynia, and pain summation (wind-up ratio). QST parameters were region specific and age dependent. Pain thresholds were significantly lower in women than men. Detection thresholds were generally independent of gender. Reference data were normalized to the specific group means and variances (region, age, gender) by calculating z-scores. Due to confidence limits close to the respective limits of the possible data range, heat hypoalgesia, cold hypoalgesia, and mechanical hyperesthesia can hardly be diagnosed. Nevertheless, these parameters can be used for group comparisons. Sensitivity is enhanced by side-to-side comparisons by a factor ranging from 1.1 to 2.5. Relative comparisons across body regions do not offer advantages over absolute reference values. Application of this standardized QST protocol in patients and human surrogate models will allow to infer underlying mechanisms from somatosensory phenotypes. ?? 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {We have compiled a comprehensive QST protocol as part of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) using well established tests for nearly all aspects of somatosensation. This protocol encompasses thermal as well as mechanical testing procedures. Our rationale was to test for patterns of sensory loss (small and large nerve fiber functions) or gain (hyperalgesia, allodynia, hyperpathia), and to assess both cutaneous and deep pain sensitivity. The practicality of the QST protocol was tested in 18 healthy subjects, 21-58 years, half of them female. All subjects were tested bilaterally over face, hand and foot. We determined thermal detection and pain thresholds including a test for the presence of paradoxical heat sensations, mechanical detection thresholds to von Frey filaments and a 64-Hz tuning fork, mechanical pain thresholds to pinprick stimuli and blunt pressure, stimulus-response-functions for pinprick and dynamic mechanical allodynia (pain to light touch), and pain summation (wind-up ratio) using repetitive pinprick stimulation. The full protocol took 27 ?? 2.3 min per test area. The majority of QST parameters were normally distributed only after logarithmic transformation (secondary normalization) except for the frequency of paradoxical heat sensations, cold and heat pain thresholds, and for vibration detection thresholds. Thresholds were usually lowest over face, followed by hand, and then foot. Only thermal pain thresholds, wind-up ratio and vibration detection thresholds were not significantly dependent on the body region. There was no significant right-to-left difference for any of the QST parameters; left-to-right correlation coefficients ranged between 0.78 and 0.97, thus explaining between 61{\%} and 94{\%} of the variance. This study has shown that a complete somatosensory profile of one affected area and one unaffected control area, which will be necessary to characterize patients with a variety of diseases, can be obtained within 1 h. Case examples of selected patients illustrate the value of z-transformed QST data for an easy survey of individual symptom profiles. ?? 2005 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract = {The estimated prevalence of patients who report minor or no improvement of their symptoms and pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains high, ranging from 5{\%} to 40{\%}. The authors sought to determine whether chronic pain and functional health are related to specific variations in demographic data, surgical techniques, or radiographic pre- and postoperative findings. They also sought to identify independent risk factors for persistent moderate-to-severe chronic pain after TKA. A total of 272 patients who underwent primary TKA from October 2006 to August 2008 with a minimum follow-up of 1 year were identified from electronic medical records. A questionnaire to identify persistent postoperative pain (36-item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]) was mailed to these patients. Linear regression and logistic regression were used to identify predictors for SF-36 and chronic pain, respectively. Thirty-nine percent of patients reported persistent pain after TKA, with a median average pain score of 3 out of 10 and worst pain score of 5 out of 10. Independent risk factors for persistent pain are the length of the operative procedure (odds ratio [OR]=1.013), medical history of diabetes mellitus (OR=0.430), presence of preoperative flexion contracture (OR=1.089), and patellofemoral joint overstuffing (OR=0.915). Persistent postoperative pain is a common finding after TKA. Nonmodifiable risk factors could be used for risk stratification, whereas modifiable risk factors could be used as a clinical guidance for modification of some aspects of existing surgical techniques.},

abstract = {Background and purpose - The discrepancy between symptoms and radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is well described. However, little is known about whether radiographic severity is predictive of the clinical result of nonoperative treatment. We investigated whether radiographic severity and treatment type were associated with improvements in pain after nonoperative treatment of patients with knee OA. Patients and methods - A 5-year consecutive series of patients deemed not eligible for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by an experienced orthopedic surgeon was contacted 1-5 years later. Radiographic severity, age, sex, and BMI were registered at the consultation. At follow-up, patients were asked to answer a questionnaire on type of treatment and improvements in pain after treatment. Results - Of 1,848 patients who were not eligible for TKA, 1,414 (77{\%}) completed the follow-up questionnaire (mean age 66 (24-96) years; 55{\%} women). Radiographic severity was not associated with improvements in pain even after adjusting for treatment type, age, sex, and BMI (p {\textgreater} 0.1). The odds ratio of improvement was higher by a factor of 2 in patients who received physiotherapy or multimodal treatment than in patients who did not. Interpretation - Radiographic severity was not associated with improvements in pain after nonoperative treatment. Patients who are not eligible for TKA can confidently be referred to nonoperative treatment even if they have severe radiographic OA. The treatment should preferably be multimodal, including physiotherapy, as recommended in Danish and international clinical guidelines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 670,000 total knee replacements are performed annually in the United States; however, high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness of the procedure, as compared with nonsurgical interventions, is lacking., METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial, we enrolled 100 patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis who were eligible for unilateral total knee replacement. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo total knee replacement followed by 12 weeks of nonsurgical treatment (total-knee-replacement group) or to receive only the 12 weeks of nonsurgical treatment (nonsurgical-treatment group), which was delivered by physiotherapists and dietitians and consisted of exercise, education, dietary advice, use of insoles, and pain medication. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 12 months in the mean score on four Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales, covering pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, and quality of life (KOOS4); scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)., RESULTS: A total of 95 patients completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. In the nonsurgical-treatment group, 13 patients (26{\%}) underwent total knee replacement before the 12-month follow-up; in the total-knee-replacement group, 1 patient (2{\%}) received only nonsurgical treatment. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the total-knee-replacement group had greater improvement in the KOOS4 score than did the nonsurgical-treatment group (32.5 vs. 16.0; adjusted mean difference, 15.8 [95{\%} confidence interval, 10.0 to 21.5]). The total-knee-replacement group had a higher number of serious adverse events than did the nonsurgical-treatment group (24 vs. 6, P=0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with knee osteoarthritis who were eligible for unilateral total knee replacement, treatment with total knee replacement followed by nonsurgical treatment resulted in greater pain relief and functional improvement after 12 months than did nonsurgical treatment alone. However, total knee replacement was associated with a higher number of serious adverse events than was nonsurgical treatment, and most patients who were assigned to receive nonsurgical treatment alone did not undergo total knee replacement before the 12-month follow-up.

Methods: Nine OSs chose the five criteria most important when deciding on TKA eligibility. Cross-sectional data from 200 patients found either eligible (n = 100) or not eligible (n = 100) for TKA by one of the nine OS, were analyzed in a regression analyses with TKA eligibility as the dependent variable. Results: Radiographic severity (n = 8), pain (n = 9), functional disability (n = 8) and not responding to the recommended non-surgical treatment (n = 7) were considered most important by OSs.Associations (P {\textless} 0.25) between TKA eligibility and criteria found important by the OS were demonstrated for worse radiographic severity and more functional limitations, but not for pain and not responding to the recommended non-surgical treatment.Furthermore, more comorbidities and higher Body Mass Index (BMI) were associated with TKA-eligibility, but not found important for TKA eligibility by the OS. Conclusion: Radiographic severity and functional limitations were confirmed as drivers for TKA eligibility, while pain was not. Not responding to non-surgical treatment was not included in the decision-making, suggesting low uptake of clinical guidelines in clinical practice. This study highlights the complexity of the decision-making with some overlap between the criteria that OSs think they apply and what is actually applied in clinical practice.},

abstract = {This article examines gender differences in health care provider?patient communication within the framework of an ecological model of communication in the medical encounter. The ecological perspective posits that, although health care provider?patient interactions are situated within a number of contexts (e.g. organizational, political, cultural), the interpersonal domain is the primary context within which these interactions unfold. Hence, gender may influence provider?patient interaction to the extent that it can be linked to the interactants? goals, skills, perceptions, emotions, and the way the participants adapt to their partner?s communication. The evidence reviewed in this essay indicates that gender differences in medical encounters may come from several sources including differences in men?s and women?s communicative styles, perceptions of their partners, and in the way they accommodate their partner?s behavior during the interaction. However, because gender is but one of many personal and partner variables (e.g. age, ethnicity, personal experiences) that can influence these processes, gender differences are often quite modest (if apparent at all) when examined across a population of health care providers and patients. Implications for future research and communicative skill training are discussed.},

abstract = {Objective: To systematically review the use of Quantitative sensory testing (QST) in pain characterisation (phenotyping) in Osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Six bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl, PubMed, Web of Science) were searched to identify studies published before May 2011. Data were extracted based on the primary site of OA, QST modalities, outcome measures and test sites. Standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated if possible. Publication bias was determined using funnel plot and Egger's test. Heterogeneity was examined using Cochran Q test and I2 statistic. Random effects model was used to pool the results. Results: Of 41 studies (2281 participants) included, 23 were case control studies, 15 case only studies, two randomised controlled trials, and one uncontrolled trial. The majority of studies examined pressure pain with smaller numbers using electrical and/or thermal stimuli. QST was more often applied to the affected joint than distal and remote sites. Of 20 studies comparing people with OA and healthy controls, seven provided sufficient information for meta-analysis. Compared with controls, people with OA had lower pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) both at the affected joint (SMD = -1.24, 95{\%}CI -1.54, -0.93) and at remote sites (SMD = -0.88, 95{\%}CI -1.11, -0.65). Conclusion: QST of PPTs demonstrated good ability to differentiate between people with OA and healthy controls. Lower PPTs in people with OA in affected sites may suggest peripheral, and in remote sites central, sensitisation. PPT measurement merits further evaluation as a tool for phenotyping OA pain. ?? 2012 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},

abstract = {In this article, we present the case for the existence of a subgroup of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who experience pain with neuropathic features. Recognizing these patients as a distinct subgroup will allow clinicians to improve the management of their symptoms. We discuss the diagnostic criteria for pain to be classed as neuropathic, then systematically examine the applicability of these criteria to the symptoms, signs and pathology of OA. What are the implications for the preclinical development and clinical use of analgesics for OA? How should existing treatment options be reassessed? Differences in the aetiology of OA and the pharmacological sensitivity of patients with OA pain with neuropathic features, compared with other patients with OA, might explain the frequent negative findings of clinical trials of treatments for symptomatic OA. If the global prevalence of OA pain with neuropathic features is accurately represented by reports from small experimental groups of patients, then a substantial unmet need to tailor diagnosis and therapy for these individuals exists.},

abstract = {Background: Patient-related outcomes have become the focus of increased attention when assessing knee arthroplasty. Methods: We retrieved questionnaires from 485 (584 knees) patients at a minimum of 3. years after undergoing primary knee arthroplasty. We excluded bilateral knee arthroplasty, leaving 141 UKA and 245 TKA who rated their satisfaction and expectation regarding pain, range of motion (ROM), daily living function (DLF), return to recreational activity (RRA) and ability to kneel (ATK) on a scale of 0 (worst) to 10 (best). We further collected data on pain level and the modified Cincinnati rating scale. Range of motion was documented pre- and postoperatively at a minimum of six months. The cohort was subdivided into three age groups and compared with each other (Group 1: {\textless}. 55, n. = 113; Group 2: 55-64, n. = 117; Group 3: 65. +, n. = 155). Results: Average satisfaction with pain, ROM and ATK for patients under 55 was higher for UKA than for TKA. Patients {\textgreater}. 65 with TKA were on average more satisfied than patients with UKA in these three items. However, patients under 55 with UKA were up to 2.9 times more likely to have their expectations met when compared to patients receiving TKA. Patients with UKA under 55 rated their joint as good/excellent in 96.0{\%} versus patients in the same age group with TKA in 81.0{\%}. Conclusions: We found that overall, younger patients who were treated with UKA demonstrated higher satisfaction scores in most subsets when compared with the patients of the same age group who received TKA. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tibial osteotomy is a treatment for younger and/or physically active patients suffering from uni-compartmental knee osteoarthritis. The open wedge osteotomy by the hemicallotasis technique includes the use of external fixation. The use of external fixation has several advantages, as early mobilization and the opportunity for optimal correction. However, the hemicallotasis technique has also been described as a cumbersome procedure for the patient. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate patient-relevant outcomes during the first 2 post-operative years. Especially the treatment period, during which external fixation was used, was closely monitored.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In an uncontrolled study, fifty-eight consecutive patients, 30 men and 28 women (mean age 54 years) were operated on by the hemicallotasis technique were evaluated with the patient-relevant outcome measure Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) preoperatively, during the treatment with external fixation, one week after removal of the external fixation, at 6 months, and at one and two years postoperatively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At the 2-year postoperative follow-up, all subscales of the KOOS were improved (p {\textless} 0.001), mostly in pain (41-80 on a 0-100 worst to best scale) and knee-related quality of life (21-61 on a 0-100 worst to best scale), compared to the preoperative status. Significant improvements in pain and other symptoms, function of daily life and quality of life were seen already during the treatment period (mean 98 +/- 18 days) with the external fixation. More demanding functions such as kneeling, squatting, jumping and running, were improved first after extraction of the external fixation device and the pins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Tibial osteotomy by the hemicallotasis technique yields large improvement in self-rated pain, function and quality of life, which persists over two years. Surprisingly, large improvements occurred already during the immediate post-operative period when the external fixation was still used.},

DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All 392 orthopedic surgeons in the province. Of the 325 practising traceable surgeons 234 (72.0{\%}) responded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Indications for knee replacement, perceived usefulness of treatments for osteoarthritis, perceived outcomes of knee replacement and number of knee replacement procedures performed by individual surgeons. RESULTS: The respondents disagreed on how 20 of 34 patient characteristics affected their decision to perform knee replacement surgery. They also disagreed on the usefulness of seven of eight treatments for arthritis of the knee. The respondents demonstrated variation in their expected outcomes of knee replacement. The surgeons who performed more procedures judged, on average, the outcomes to be better and to have fewer complications than the surgeons who performed fewer procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgeons demonstrated disagreement about some of the indications for knee replacement, the usefulness of treatments for arthritis of the knee and the perceived outcomes of knee replacement. The areas of greatest disagreement should be the focus of future research and the development of practice guidelines.},

abstract = {Purpose: To develop concise, patient-focussed, up to date, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), which are adaptable and designed to assist physicians and allied health care professionals in general and specialist practise throughout the world. Methods: Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines (primary care, rheumatology, orthopaedics and evidence-based medicine), two continents and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. A systematic review of existing guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA published between 1945 and January 2006 was undertaken using the validated appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument. A core set of management modalities was generated based on the agreement between guidelines. Evidence before 2002 was based on a systematic review conducted by European League Against Rheumatism and evidence after 2002 was updated using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library and HTA reports. The quality of evidence was evaluated, and where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk or odds ratio and cost per quality-adjusted life years gained were estimated. Consensus recommendations were produced following a Delphi exercise and the strength of recommendation (SOR) for propositions relating to each modality was determined using a visual analogue scale. Results: Twenty-three treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA were identified from the literature search, including six opinion-based, five evidence-based and 12 based on both expert opinion and research evidence. Twenty out of 51 treatment modalities addressed by these guidelines were universally recommended. ES for pain relief varied from treatment to treatment. Overall there was no statistically significant difference between non-pharmacological therapies [0.25, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.16, 0.34] and pharmacological therapies (ES = 0.39, 95{\%} CI 0.31, 0.47). Following feedback from Osteoarthritis Research International members on the draft guidelines and six Delphi rounds consensus was reached on 25 carefully worded recommendations. Optimal management of patients with OA hip or knee requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities of therapy. Recommendations cover the use of 12 non-pharmacological modalities: education and self-management, regular telephone contact, referral to a physical therapist, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. Eight recommendations cover pharmacological modalities of treatment including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) non-selective and selective oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronates, glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulphate for symptom relief; glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and diacerein for possible structure-modifying effects and the use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of refractory pain. There are recommendations covering five surgical modalities: total joint replacements, unicompartmental knee replacement, osteotomy and joint preserving surgical procedures; joint lavage and arthroscopic debridement in knee OA, and joint fusion as a salvage procedure when joint replacement had failed. Strengths of recommendation and 95{\%} CIs are provided. Conclusion: Twenty-five carefully worded recommendations have been generated based on a critical appraisal of existing guidelines, a systematic review of research evidence and the consensus opinions of an international, multidisciplinary group of experts. The recommendations may be adapted for use in different countries or regions according to the availability of treatment modalities and SOR for each modality of therapy. These recommendations will be revised regularly following systematic review of new research evidence as this becomes available. ?? 2008 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},
