Chronic postoperative pain in patients, who have undergone a total knee arthroplasty (TKA), is a common problem. Approximately 20\% of patients with knee osteoarthritis develop chronic postoperative pain after a TKA operation. It is believed that central sensitization can be a factor in the development of chronic postoperative pain. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a battery of tests, which are used to detect patient response to stimuli. Three of these tests: pressure-pain threshold (PPT), temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM), can be used to detect central sensitization in patients.\\
In this study, a systematic search of current literature is performed to assess, how QST can be implemented as a supplement to the decision of whether or not the patient is eligible for a TKA operation is made. This assessment is analyzed within nine different perspectives such as QST, the patient and the organization. \\

It is concluded that PPT, TSP and CPM could work as a supplementary diagnostic tool to reinforce the decision, but it is necessary to compile normative data before the clinician can categorize the patients based on the tests.
